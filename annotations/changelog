    (const_)reverse_iterators (cf. 21.14.2: Implementing a

  * Removed the `text to anything convertor' section, which is now obsoleted
    by existing std::string conversion functions.

    the `Koenig lookup' section.

 -- Frank B. Brokken <f.b.brokken@rug.nl>  Wed, 20 Jul 2011 12:21:33 +0200

9.0.0

  * The form of move special members (move constructors, move assignment
    operators, other functions defining rvalue type parameters) was
    synchronized with the form proposed by the C++0x standard. This resulted,
    in the Annotations relaxing the principle of const-correctness, and in
    modifying the declarations and implementations of move special members in
    this release. This shift in position (adopted by the Annotations since
    its very early releases) profoundly affects much of the Annotation's
    contents, and warrants an upgrade to the next major release. See the
    remarks in the `what's new' file for more details.
    
  * Several sections were added and sometimes moved. The section about
    'unrestricted unions' was completed and moved to the `Containers'
    chapter, and an new section about adding binary operators to classes using
    function templates was added to the Annotations' final chapter (concrete
    examples).

  * Repaired badly formatted LaTeX table of contents: see bin/latexonly

  * Many typos were repaired

8.3.1

  * Many typos, textual corrections and clarifications were processed, almost
    all were provided by Francesco Poli.

  * Sections about move operations were split into subsections

  * The Portuguese translations are lagging too much behind. I've removed them
    from the source archives, although they remain available at the svn
    repository. 

 -- Frank B. Brokken <f.b.brokken@rug.nl>  Mon, 20 Dec 2010 15:25:30 +0100

8.3.0

  * New sections about various (member) function adaptors 

  * Sections about statistical sampling functions added/modified

  * Sections referring to C++0x elements now assume g++ 4.4 is available and
    the required compiler version is no longer listed for those sections

  * Typos repaired

 -- Frank B. Brokken <f.b.brokken@rug.nl>  Tue, 07 Sep 2010 12:12:18 +0200

8.2.0

  * Bumped up the version. Should have been done earlier, considering that the
    'what's new' file already refers to version 8.2.0.

  * Added 'export' to the list of keywords 

  * New typos and unclear passages were processed/improved

  * KNOWN ISSUE WITH THE PDF VERSION: Due to a known bug in the ps2pdf
    conversion the pdf versions of the Annotations may show multiple
        Error: Illegal entry in bfrange block in ToUnicode CMap
    error messages. Once the bug has been repaired a new sub-minor release of
    the Annotations will be made available.

 -- Frank B. Brokken <f.b.brokken@rug.nl>  Thu, 26 Aug 2010 09:03:37 +0200

8.1.2

  * New typos and unclear passages were processed/improved

 -- Frank B. Brokken <f.b.brokken@rug.nl>  Thu, 06 May 2010 19:39:46 +0200

8.1.1

  * Many typos and minor cosmetic flaws that had escaped the previous update
    were processed 

 -- Frank B. Brokken <f.b.brokken@rug.nl>  Thu, 11 Mar 2010 21:00:43 +0100

8.1.0 

  * The text and examples of the Annotations have completely been overhauled.
Before this final 8.1.0 release two pre-releases were issued, partially
completing the overhaul (see the two entries below) Over the years many
inconsistencies had crept into the text and examples, that are now removed;
streamlining the text and the examples.  All of the code examples have
received a work-over, removing endl in favor of '\n', making virtual functions
private, etc., etc. Many sections labeled C++0x were improved and sections in
the table of contents showing C++0x now also mention the g++ version in which
the new feature will be made available, using `?'  if this is as yet
unknown. No version is shown if the feature is already available in g++ 4.3
(or in one of its subreleases, like 4.3.3).  I received a host of suggestions
from Francesco Poli (thanks, Francesco (and several others), for all the
effort you've put into sending me those corrections).

 -- Frank B. Brokken <f.b.brokken@rug.nl>  Mon, 01 Mar 2010 09:11:21 +0100

8.1.0~pre2

  * Cleanup completed until (including) chapter 16

 -- Frank B. Brokken <f.b.brokken@rug.nl>  Thu, 24 Dec 2009 11:36:44 +0100

8.1.0~pre1  

  * Removed the 'template concepts' section from advancedtemplates: removed
    from the C++0x standard.
  * Started a cleanup operation on the C++ Annotations aiming at improving
    its internal consistency in examples and text. In this version 
    completed until (including) chapter 8.
