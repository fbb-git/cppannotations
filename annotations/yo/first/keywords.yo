bf(C++)'s  i(keywords) are a superset of bf(C)'s  keywords. Here is a
list of all keywords of the language:

    Notes:
    itemization(
    it() The ti(export) keyword is no longer actively used by bf(C++), but it
is kept as a keyword, reserved for future use.
    it() Since the i(C++17) standard the keyword ti(register) is no longer
        used, but it remains a reserved identifer. In other words, definitions
        like verb(
    register int index;
       ) 
        result in compilation errors. Also, tt(register) is no longer
        considered a i(storage class specifier) (storage class specifiers are
        tt(extern, thread_local, mutable) and tt(static)).
    it() the hi(operator: keywords)em(operator keywords): tt(and, and_eq,
bitand, bitor, compl, not, not_eq, or, or_eq, xor) and tt(xor_eq) are symbolic
alternatives for, respectively, tt(&&, &=, &, |, ~, !, !=, ||, |=, ^) and
tt(^=).
    it() bf(C++) also recognizes the special identifiers tt(final) and
tt(override). These identifiers are special in the sense that they acquire
special meanings when declaring classes or polymorphic functions. Section
ref(FINAL) provides further details.

Keywords can only be used for their intended purpose and cannot be used as
names for other entities (e.g., variables, functions, class-names, etc.). In
addition to keywords i(identifiers starting with an underscore) and living in
the emi(global namespace) (i.e., not using any explicit namespace or using the
mere tt(::) namespace specification) or living in the em(std namespace) are
 i(reserved identifiers) in the sense that their use is a prerogative of the
implementor.
