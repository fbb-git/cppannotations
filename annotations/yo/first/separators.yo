The cXIV() standard introduces em(digit separators)hi(digit separator) for
integer and floating point literals. The digit separator is a single quote
which may be inserted between digits of such literals to enhance human
readability. Multiple digit separators may be used, but only one separator can
be inserted between successive digits. E.g.,
        verb(
    1'000'000
    3.141'592'653'589'793'238'5
    ''123       // won't compile
    1''23       // won't compile either
        )
