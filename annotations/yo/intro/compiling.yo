To compile a bf(C++) program, a bf(C++) i(compiler) is required. Considering
the free nature of this document, it won't come as a surprise that a
 emi(free compiler) is suggested here. The
 i(Free Software Foundation) (i(FSF)) provides at hi(http://www.gnu.org)
 tlurl(http://www.gnu.org) a free bf(C++)
compiler which is, among other places, also part of the i(Debian)
 hi(http://www.debian.org)
 (tlurl(http://www.debian.org)) distribution of i(Linux)
 (hi(http://www.linux.org) tlurl(http://www.linux.org)).

To use the features of the latest standard the i(compiler flag)
ti(--std=c++14) must currently be provided. In the annotations() it is assumed
that this flag is used when compiling the examples.
