Functions defined elsewhere may be linked to code that uses these
functions. Such functions are normally declared in header files, either as
standalone functions or as class member functions.

Those functions may of course throw exceptions. Declarations of such functions
may contain a (now deprecated, see also section ref(NOEXCEPT)) hi(throw list)
emi(function throw list) or
    emi(exception specification list) specifying the types of the exceptions
that can be thrown by the function. For example, a function that may throw
`tt(char *)' and `tt(int)' exceptions can be declared as
        verb(
    void exceptionThrower() throw(char *, int);
        )
    A function throw list immediately follows the function header (and it also
follows a possible tt(const) specifier).  Throw lists may be empty. It has the
following general form:
        verb(
    throw([type1 [, type2, type3, ...]])
        )

    If a function is guaranteed not to throw exceptions an
 i(empty function throw list) may be used. E.g.,
        verb(
    void noExceptions() throw ();
        )
    In all cases, the function header used in the function definition must
exactly match the function header used in the declaration, including a
possibly empty function throw list.

    A function for which a function throw list is specified may only throw
exceptions of the types mentioned in its throw list. A emi(run-time error)
occurs if it throws other types of exceptions than those mentioned in the
function throw list. Example: the function tt(charPintThrower) shown below
clearly throws a tt(char const *) exception. Since tt(intThrower) may
throw an tt(int) exception, the function throw list of tt(charPintThrower)
must em(also) contain tt(int).
        verbinclude(-a examples/throwlist.cc)

    A function without a throw list may throw any kind of exception.  Without
a function throw list the program's designer is responsible for providing the
correct handlers.

For various reason declaring exception throwers is now deprecated. Declaring
exception throwers does not imply that the em(compiler) checks whether an
improper exception is thrown. Rather, the function will be surrounded by
additional code in which the actual exception that is thrown is
processed. Instead of compile time checks one gets run-time overhead,
resulting in additional code (and execution time) thay is added to the
function's code. One could write, e.g.,
        verb(
    void fun() throw (int)
    {
        // code of this function, throwing exceptions
    }
        )
    but the function would be compiled to something like the following (cf.
section ref(FUNTRY) for the use of tt(try) immediately following the
function's header and section ref(STDEXC) for a description of
 ti(bad_exception)):
        verb(
    void fun()
    try         // this code resulting from throw(int)
    {
                // the function's code, throwing all kinds of exceptions
    }
    catch (int) // remaining code resulting from throw(int)
    {
        throw;  // rethrow the exception, so it can be caught by the
                // `intended' handler
    }
    catch (...) // catch any other exception
    {
        throw bad_exception;
    }
        )
    Run-time overhead is caused by doubling the number of thrown and caught
exceptions. Without a throw list a thrown tt(int) is simply caught by its
intended handler; with a throw list the tt(int) is em(first) caught by the
`safeguarding' handler added to the function. In there it is em(rethrown) to
be caught by its intended handler next.
