<h2 >NAME</h2>C++-Annotations - Extensive tutorial about the C++ programming language
<p>
<h2 >DESCRIPTION</h2>
<p>
The <strong >C++</strong> Annotations offer an extensive tutorial about the <strong >C++</strong>
programming language. It can be used as a textbook for <strong >C/C++</strong> programming
courses. 
<p>
This document is intended for knowledgeable users of <strong >C</strong> (or any other
language using a <strong >C</strong>-like grammar, like <strong >Perl</strong> or <strong >Java</strong>) who would like
to know more about, or make the transition to, <strong >C++</strong>. This document is the
main textbook for Frank's <strong >C++</strong> programming courses, which are yearly
organized at the University of Groningen, the Netherlands.
<p>
The <strong >C++</strong> Annotations do not cover all aspects of <strong >C++</strong>, though. In
particular, <strong >C++</strong>'s basic grammar, which is, for all practical purposes,
equal to <strong >C</strong>'s grammar, is not covered. For this part of the <strong >C++</strong>
language, the reader should consult other texts, like a book covering the
<strong >C</strong> programming language.
<p>
The package offers the <strong >C++</strong> Annotations in the following document formats:
    <ul>
    <li> Plain ascii text (<em >cplusplus.txt</em>);
    <li> LaTeX, including a <em >.dvi</em> file (in the subdirectory <em >latex/</em>);
    <li> PostScript (in the subdirectory <em >ps/</em>);
    <li> Pdf (in the subdirectory <em >pdf/</em>);
    <li> html (in the subdirectory <em >html/</em>);
    </ul>
    The postscript, pdf and LaTeX formats were constructed for two different
paper-sizes: A4 and legal.
<p>
Depending on your installation type, the documents may also appear in
compressed forms (e.g., <em >cplusplus.txt.gz, cplusplus.html.zip</em>).
<p>

    All installed files (except for this man-page) are found at
