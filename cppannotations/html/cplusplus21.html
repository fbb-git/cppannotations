<h1 >Chapter 21: Function and Variable Templates</h1>

<strong >C++</strong> supports syntactic constructs allowing programmers to define and use
completely general (or abstract) functions or classes, based on generic types
and/or (possibly inferred) constant values. In the chapters on abstract
containers (chapter <a href="cplusplus12.html#CONTAINERS">12</a>) and the <code >STL</code> (chapter <a href="cplusplus18.html#STL">18</a>) we've
already used these constructs, commonly known as the
    <a name="an2692"></a><em >template mechanism</em>.
<p>
The template mechanism allows us to specify classes and algorithms, fairly
independently of the actual types for which the templates are eventually going
to be used. Whenever the template is used, the compiler generates code that is
tailored to the particular data type(s) used with the template. This code is
generated at <a name="an2693"></a>compile-time from the template's definition. The piece of
generated code is called an <a name="an2694"></a><em >instantiation</em> of the template.
<p>
In this chapter the syntactic peculiarities of templates are covered.  The
notions of <em >template type parameter</em>, <em >template non-type parameter</em>, and
<a name="an2695"></a><em >function template</em> are introduced and several examples of templates are
provided (both in this chapter and in chapter <a href="cplusplus24.html#CONCRETE">24</a>).  Template
<em >classes</em> are covered in chapter <a href="cplusplus22.html#TEMPCLASS">22</a>. For good reasons variadic
functions 
    <a name="an2696"></a><a name="an2697"></a> 
 are deprecated in <strong >C++</strong>. However, <em >variadic templates</em> tell us a
completely different story, and variadic templates are perfectly
acceptable. Both function- and class-templates can be defined as variadic
templates. Both forms are covered in section <a href="cplusplus22.html#VARIADIC">22.5</a>.
<p>
Templates already offered by the language include the abstract containers
(cf. chapter <a href="cplusplus12.html#CONTAINERS">12</a>); the <code >string</code> (cf. chapter <a href="cplusplus05.html#String">5</a>);
streams (cf. chapter <a href="cplusplus06.html#IOStreams">6</a>); and the generic algorithms (cf. chapter
<a href="cplusplus19.html#GENERIC">19</a>). So, templates play a central role in present-day <strong >C++</strong>, and
should not be considered an esoteric feature of the language.
<p>
Templates should be approached somewhat similarly as generic algorithms:
they're a <em >way of life</em>; a <strong >C++</strong> software engineer should actively look
for opportunities to use them.  Initially, templates may appear to be rather
complex and you might be tempted to turn your back on them. However, over time
their strengths and benefits are more and more appreciated. Eventually you'll
be able to recognize opportunities for using templates. That's the time where
your efforts should no longer focus on constructing ordinary functions
 <a name="an2698"></a> and classes <a name="an2699"></a> (i.e., functions or
classes that are not templates), but on constructing templates.
<p>
This chapter starts by introducing <em >function templates</em>. The emphasis is on
the required syntax. This chapter lays the foundation upon which the other
chapters about templates are built.
<p>
<a name="TEMPFUNDEF"></a><a name="l492"></a>
<h2 >21.1: Defining function templates</h2>
A <a name="an2700"></a>function template's definition is very similar to the definition of
a normal function. A function template has a function head, a function body, a
return type, possibly overloaded definitions, etc.. However, different from
ordinary functions, function templates always use one or more
 <a name="an2701"></a><em >formal types</em>: types for which almost any existing
(class or primitive) type could be used. Let's have a look at a simple
example. The following function <code >add</code> expects two <code >Type</code> arguments and
returns their sum:
        <pre>
    Type add(Type const &amp;lvalue, Type const &amp;rvalue)
    {
        return lvalue + rvalue;
    }
</pre>
    Note how closely the above function's definition follows its description.
It receives two arguments, and returns its sum. Now consider what would happen
if we defined this function for, e.g., <code >int</code> values. We would write:
        <pre>
    int add(int const &amp;lvalue, int const &amp;rvalue)
    {
        return lvalue + rvalue;
    }
</pre>
    So far, so good. However, were we to add two doubles, we would overload
this function:
        <pre>
    double add(double const &amp;lvalue, double const &amp;rvalue)
    {
        return lvalue + rvalue;
    }
</pre>
    There is no end to the number of overloaded versions we might be forced to
construct: an overloaded version for <code >string</code>, for <code >size_t</code>, for .... In
general, we would need an overloaded version for every type supporting
<code >operator+</code> and a copy constructor. All these overloaded versions of
basically the same function are required because of the strongly typed nature
of <strong >C++</strong>. Because of this, a truly generic function cannot be constructed
without resorting to the <a name="an2702"></a>template mechanism.
<p>
Fortunately, we've already seen an important part of a template
function. Our initial function <code >add</code> actually is an implementation of such a
function although it isn't a full template definition yet. If we gave the
first <code >add</code> function to the compiler, it would produce an error message
like:
        <pre>
    error: `Type' was not declared in this scope
    error: parse error before `const'
</pre>
    And rightly so, as we failed to define <code >Type</code>. The error is prevented
when we change <code >add</code> into a full template definition. To do this, we look
at the function's implementation and decide that <code >Type</code> is actually a
<em >formal</em> typename. Comparing it to the alternate implementations, it is
clear that we could have changed <code >Type</code> into <code >int</code> to get the first
implementation, and into <code >double</code> to get the second.
<p>
The full template definition allows for this formal nature of the
<code >Type</code> typename. Using the keyword <code >template</code>, we prefix one line to
our initial definition, obtaining the following function template
definition:
        <pre>
    template &lt;typename Type&gt;
    Type add(Type const &amp;lvalue, Type const &amp;rvalue)
    {
        return lvalue + rvalue;
    }
</pre>
<p>
In this definition we distinguish:
    <ul>
    <li> The keyword <a name="an2703"></a><code >template</code>, starting a template definition or
declaration.
    <li> The angle bracket enclosed list following <code >template</code>. This is a
list containing one or more comma-separated elements. This angle bracket
enclosed list is called the
 <a name="an2704"></a><em >template parameter list</em>. Template parameter lists using multiple
elements could look like this:
        <pre>
    typename Type1, typename Type2
</pre>
    <li> Inside the template parameter list we find the <a name="an2705"></a><em >formal type</em> name
<code >Type</code>. It is a formal type name, comparable to a formal parameter name in a
function's definition. Up to now we've only encountered formal variable names
with functions. The <em >types</em> of the parameters were always known by the time
the function was defined. Templates escalate the notion of formal names one
step further up the ladder. Templates allow type names to be formalized,
rather than just the variable names themselves. The fact that <code >Type</code> is a
formal type name is indicated by the keyword <code >typename</code>, prefixed to
<code >Type</code> in the template parameter list. A formal type name like <code >Type</code> is
also called a <a name="an2706"></a><em >template type parameter</em>. Template non-type parameters also
exist, and are shortly introduced.
<p>
Other texts on <strong >C++</strong> sometimes use the keyword <a name="an2707"></a><code >class</code> where we use
<a name="an2708"></a> <code >typename</code>. So, in other texts template definitions
might start with a line like:
        <pre>
    template &lt;class Type&gt;
</pre>
    In the <strong >C++</strong> Annotations the use of <code >typename</code> over <code >class</code> is preferred,
reasoning that a template type parameter is, after all, a type name (some
authors prefer <code >class</code> over <code >typename</code>; in the end it's a matter of
taste).
    <li> The <code >template</code> keyword and the template parameter list is called
the <a name="an2709"></a>template header.
    <li> The function head: it is like a normal function head, albeit that the
template's type parameters must be used in its parameter list. When the
function is eventually called using actual arguments having actual types,
these actual types are used by the compiler to infer which version (i.e.,
overload to fit the actual argument types) of the function template must be
used. At the point where the function is called the compiler creates the
function that is called, a process called <a name="an2710"></a><em >instantiation</em>. The function
head may also use a formal type to specify its return value. This feature was
actually used in the <code >add</code> template's definition.
    <li> The function parameters are specified as <code >Type const &amp;</code>
parameters. This has the usual meaning: the parameters are references to
<code >Type</code> objects or values that will not be modified by the function.
    <li> The function body is like a normal function body. In the body the
formal type names may be used to define or declare variables, which may then
be used as any other local variable. But some restrictions apply. Looking at
<code >add</code>'s body, it is clear that <code >operator+</code> is used, as well as a copy
constructor, as the function returns a value. This allows us to formulate the
following restrictions for the formal type <code >Type</code> as used by our <code >add</code>
function template:
        <ul>
        <li> <code >Type</code> should support <code >operator+</code>
        <li> <code >Type</code> should support a copy constructor
        </ul>
    Consequently, while <code >Type</code> could be a <code >string</code>, it could never be
an <code >ostream</code>, as neither <code >operator+</code> nor the copy constructor are
available for streams.
    </ul>
    Normal scope rules and identifier visibility rules apply to templates.
Within the template definition's scope formal type names overrule identically
named identifiers of broader scopes.

<h3 >21.1.1: Considerations regarding template parameters</h3>
    We've managed to design our first function template:
        <pre>
    template &lt;typename Type&gt;
    Type add(Type const &amp;lvalue, Type const &amp;rvalue)
    {
        return lvalue + rvalue;
    }
</pre>
<p>
Look again at <code >add</code>'s parameters.  By specifying <code >Type const &amp;</code>
rather than <code >Type</code> superfluous copying is prevented, at the same time
allowing values of primitive types to be passed as arguments to the
function. So, when <code >add(3, 4)</code> is called, <code >int{4}</code> is assigned to
<code >Type const &amp;rvalue</code>. In general, function parameters should be defined as
<code >Type const &amp;</code> to prevent unnecessary copying. The compiler is smart enough
to handle `references to references' in this case, which is something the
language normally does not support. For example, consider the following
<code >main</code> function (here and in the following simple examples it is assumed
that the template and the required headers and namespace declarations have
been provided):
        <pre>
    int main()
    {
        size_t const &amp;var = size_t{4};
        cout &lt;&lt; add(var, var) &lt;&lt; '\n';
    }
</pre>
    Here <code >var</code> is a reference to a constant <code >size_t</code>. It is passed as
argument to <code >add</code>, thereby initializing <code >lvalue</code> and <code >rvalue</code> as <code >Type
const &amp;</code> to <code >size_t const &amp;</code> values. The compiler interprets <code >Type</code> as
<code >size_t</code>. Alternatively, the parameters might have been specified using
<code >Type &amp;</code>, rather than <code >Type const &amp;</code>. The disadvantage of this (non-const)
specification being that temporary values cannot be passed to the function
anymore. The following therefore fails to compile:
        <pre>
    int main()
    {
        cout &lt;&lt; add(string{"a"}, string{"b"}) &lt;&lt; '\n';
    }
</pre>
    Here, a <code >string const &amp;</code> cannot be used to initialize a <code >string &amp;</code>.
Had <code >add</code> defined <code >Type &amp;&amp;</code> parameters then the above program would have
compiled just fine. In addition the following example correctly compiles as
the compiler decides that <code >Type</code> apparently is a <code >string const</code>:
        <pre>
    int main()
    {
        string const &amp;s = string{"a"};
        cout &lt;&lt; add(s, s) &lt;&lt; '\n';
    }
</pre>
    What can we deduce from these examples?
    <ul>
    <li> In general, function parameters should be specified as <code >Type const
&amp;</code> parameters to prevent unnecessary copying.
    <li> The template mechanism is fairly flexible.  Formal types are
interpreted as plain types, const types, pointer types, etc., depending on the
actually provided types. The <a name="an2711"></a>rule of thumb is that the formal type is used
as a generic mask for the actual type, with the formal type name covering
whatever part of the actual type must be covered. Some examples, assuming the
parameter is defined as <code >Type const &amp;</code>:
            <div style="text-align: center">
        <table>

        <td colspan=2><hr/></td>

        
<tr >

            <td > <strong >Provided argument:</strong></td> <td > <strong >Actually used Type:</strong></td>

         
</tr>

        <td colspan=2><hr/></td>

        
<tr >

            <td > <code >size_t const</code></td> <td > <code >size_t</code></td>

         
</tr>

        
<tr >

            <td > <code >size_t</code></td> <td > <code >size_t</code></td>

         
</tr>

        
<tr >

            <td > <code >size_t *</code></td> <td > <code >size_t *</code></td>

         
</tr>

        
<tr >

            <td > <code >size_t const *</code></td> <td > <code >size_t const *</code></td>

         
</tr>

        <td colspan=2><hr/></td>

        
</table>
            </div>
    </ul>
    As a second example of a function template, consider the following
function template:
        <pre>
    template &lt;typename Type, size_t Size&gt;
    Type sum(Type const (&amp;array)[Size])
    {
        Type tp{};  // note: the default constructor must exist.

        for (size_t idx = 0; idx &lt; Size; idx++)
            tp += array[idx];

        return tp;
    }
</pre>
    This template definition introduces the following new concepts and
features:
    <ul>
    <li> The <a name="an2712"></a><em >template parameter list</em>. This template parameter list has
two elements. The first element is a well-known template type parameter, but
the second element has a very specific type: a <code >size_t</code>. Template parameters
of specific (i.e., non-formal) types used in template parameter lists are
called
 <a name="an2713"></a><em >template non-type parameters</em>.
    A template non-type parameter defines the type of a
 <a name="an2714"></a>constant expression, which must be known by the time the template is
instantiated and which is specified in terms of existing types, such as a
<code >size_t</code>.
    <li> Looking at the function's head, we see one parameter:
        <pre>
Type const (&amp;array)[Size]
</pre>
    This parameter defines <code >array</code> as a reference to an array having
<code >Size</code> elements of type <code >Type</code> that may not be modified.
    <li> In the parameter definition, both <code >Type</code> and <code >Size</code> are
used. <code >Type</code> is of course the template's type parameter <code >Type</code>, but
<code >Size</code> is also a template parameter. It is a <code >size_t</code>, whose value must be
inferable by the compiler when it compiles an actual call of the <code >sum</code>
function template. Consequently, <code >Size</code> must be a <code >const</code> value. Such a
constant expression is called a <em >template non-type parameter</em>, and its type
is named in the template's parameter list.
    <li> When the function template is called, the compiler must be able to
infer not only <code >Type</code>'s concrete value, but also <code >Size</code>'s value. Since
the function <code >sum</code> only has one parameter, the compiler is only able to
infer <code >Size</code>'s value from the function's actual argument. It can do so if
the provided argument is an array (of known and fixed size) rather
than a pointer to <code >Type</code> elements. So, in the following <code >main</code> function
the first statement will compile correctly but the second statement
will not:
    <pre>
int main()
{
    int values[5];
    int *ip = values;

    cout &lt;&lt; sum(values) &lt;&lt; '\n';    // compiles OK
    cout &lt;&lt; sum(ip) &lt;&lt; '\n';        // won't compile
}
</pre>
    <li> Inside the function's body the statement <code >Type tp = Type()</code> is used
to initialize <code >tp</code> to a default value. Note here that no fixed value (like
0) is used. Any type's default value may be obtained using its default
constructor
 <a name="an2715"></a>
    rather than using a fixed numeric value. Of course, not every class
accepts a numeric value as an argument to one of its constructors. But all
types, even the primitive types, support default constructors (actually, some
classes do not implement a default constructor, or make it inaccessible; but
most do). The default constructor <a name="an2716"></a> of primitive
types initializes their variables to 0 (or <code >false</code>). Furthermore, the
statement <code >Type tp = Type()</code> is a true initialization: <code >tp</code> is initialized
by <code >Type</code>'s default constructor, rather than using <code >Type</code>'s copy
constructor to assign <code >Type</code>'s copy to <code >tp</code>.
<p>
It's interesting to note here (although not directly related to the
current topic) that the syntactic construction <code >Type tp(Type())</code> <em >cannot</em>
be used, even though it also looks like a proper initialization. Usually an
initializing argument can be provided to an object's definition, like
<code >string s("hello")</code>. Why, then, is <code >Type tp = Type()</code> accepted, whereas
<code >Type tp(Type())</code> isn't?  When <code >Type tp(Type())</code> is used it won't result
in an error message. So we don't immediately detect that it's <em >not</em> a
<code >Type</code> object's default initialization. Instead, the compiler starts
generating error messages once <code >tp</code> is used. This is caused by the fact that
in <strong >C++</strong> (and in <strong >C</strong> alike) the compiler does its best to recognize a
function or
 <a name="an2717"></a> function pointer whenever possible: the
<a name="an2718"></a><em >function prevalence rule</em>.  According to this rule <code >Type()</code> is (because
of the pair of parentheses) interpreted as a <em >pointer to a function</em>
expecting no arguments; returning a <code >Type</code>. The compiler will do so unless
it clearly isn't possible to do so. In the initialization <code >Type tp = Type()</code>
it <em >can't</em> see a pointer to a function as a <code >Type</code> object cannot be given
the value of a function pointer (remember: <code >Type()</code> is interpreted as
<code >Type (*)()</code> whenever possible). But in <code >Type tp(Type())</code> it <em >can</em> use
the pointer interpretation: <code >tp</code> is now <em >declared</em> as a <em >function</em>
expecting a pointer to a function returning a <code >Type</code>, with <code >tp</code> itself
also returning a <code >Type</code>. E.g., <code >tp</code> could have been defined as:
    <pre>
Type tp(Type (*funPtr)())
{
    return (*funPtr)();
}
</pre>
    <li> Comparable to the first function template, <code >sum</code> also assumes the
existence of certain public members in <code >Type</code>'s class. This time
<code >operator+=</code> and <code >Type</code>'s copy constructor.
    </ul>
<p>
Like class definitions, template definitions should not contain <code >using</code>
        <a name="an2719"></a><a name="an2720"></a>
    directives or declarations: the template might be used in a situation
where such a directive overrides the programmer's intentions: ambiguities or
other conflicts may result from the template's author and the programmer using
different <code >using</code> directives (E.g, a <code >cout</code> variable defined in the
<code >std</code> namespace and in the programmer's own namespace). Instead, within
template definitions only <a name="an2721"></a><a name="an2722"></a>
fully qualified names, including all required namespace specifications should
be used.
<p>
<a name="l494"></a>
<h3 >21.1.2: Late-specified return type</h3>
    Traditional  <strong >C++</strong> requires function templates to specify their return type
or to specify the return type as a template type parameter. Consider the
following function:
        <pre>
    int add(int lhs, int rhs)
    {
        return lhs + rhs;
    }
</pre>
 The above function may be converted to a function template:
        <pre>
    template &lt;typename Lhs, typename Rhs&gt;
    Lhs add(Lhs lhs, Rhs rhs)
    {
        return lhs + rhs;
    }
</pre>
 Unfortunately, when the function template is called as
        <pre>
    add(3, 3.4)
</pre>
 the intended return type is probably a <code >double</code> rather than an
<code >int</code>. This can be solved by adding an additional template type parameter
specifying the return type but then  that type must explicitly be specified:
        <pre>
    add&lt;double&gt;(3, 3.4);
</pre>
 Using <a name="an2723"></a><code >decltype</code> (cf. section <a href="cplusplus03.html#AUTO">3.3.5</a>) to define the return type won't
work as <code >lhs</code> and <code >rhs</code> aren't known to the compiler by the time
<code >decltype</code> is used. Thus the next attempt to get rid of the additional
template type parameter fails to compile:
        <pre>
    template &lt;typename Lhs, typename Rhs&gt;
    decltype(lhs + rhs) add(Lhs lhs, Rhs rhs)
    {
        return lhs + rhs;
    }
</pre>
<p>
The <code >decltype</code>-based definition of a function's return type may become
fairly complex. This complexity can be reduced by using the 
 <a name="an2724"></a><em >late-specified return type</em> syntax that <em >does</em> allow the use of
<code >decltype</code> to define a function's return type. It is primarily used with
function templates but it may also be used for ordinary (non-template)
functions:
        <pre>
    template &lt;typename Lhs, typename Rhs&gt;
    auto add(Lhs lhs, Rhs rhs) -&gt; decltype(lhs + rhs)
    {
        return lhs + rhs;
    }
</pre>
 When this function is used in a statement like <code >cout &lt;&lt; add(3, 3.4)</code> the
resulting value will be 6.4, which is most likely the intended result, rather
than 6. As an example how a late-specified return type may reduce the
complexity of a function's return type definition consider the following:
        <pre>
    template &lt;typename T, typename U&gt;
    decltype((*(T*)0)+(*(U*)0)) add(T t, U u);
</pre>
    Using a late-specified return type we get the equivalent:
        <pre>
    template &lt;typename T, typename U&gt;
    auto add(T t, U u) -&gt; decltype(t+u);
</pre>
    which most people think is easier to read.
<p>
The expression specified with <code >decltype</code> does not necessarily use the
parameters <code >lhs</code> and <code >rhs</code> themselves. In the next function
definition <code >lhs.length</code> is used instead of <code >lhs</code> itself:
        <pre>
    template &lt;typename Class, typename Rhs&gt;
    auto  add(Class lhs, Rhs rhs) -&gt; decltype(lhs.length() + rhs)
    {
        return lhs.length() + rhs;
    }
</pre>
    <em >Any</em> variable visible at the time <code >decltype</code> is compiled can be used
in the <code >decltype</code> expression. However, it is currently not possible to
handle member selection through pointers to members. The following code aims
at specifying the address of a member function as <code >add</code>'s first argument and
then use its return value type to determine the function template's return
type:
        <pre>
    std::string global;

    template &lt;typename MEMBER, typename RHS&gt;
    auto  add(MEMBER mem, RHS rhs) -&gt; decltype((global.*mem)() + rhs)
    {
        return (global.*mem)() + rhs;
    }
</pre>
    Although the above function compiles fine, it cannot currently be used as
it results in a compiler error message like
    <a name="an2725"></a><em >unimplemented: mangling dotstar_expr</em> (generated for a statement like
<code >cout &lt;&lt; add(&amp;string::length, 3.4)</code>).

<h2 >21.2: Passing arguments by reference (reference wrappers)</h2>
Before using the reference wrappers discussed in this section the
<a name="an2726"></a><code >&lt;functional&gt;</code> header file must be included.
<p>
Situations exist where the compiler is unable to infer that a reference rather
than a value is passed to a function template. In the following example the
function template  <code >outer</code> receives <code >int x</code> as its argument and the
compiler dutifully infers that <code >Type</code> is <code >int</code>:
        <pre>
    template &lt;typename Type&gt;
    void outer(Type t)
    {
        t.x();
    }
    void useInt()
    {
        int arg;
        outer(arg);
    }
</pre>
<p>
Compilation will of course fail and the compiler nicely reports the
inferred type, e.g.:
        <pre>
    In function 'void outer(Type) [with Type = int]': ...
</pre>
<p>
Unfortunately the same error is generated when using <code >call</code> in the next
example. The function <code >call</code> is a template expecting a function that takes
an argument which is then itself modified, and a value to pass on to that
function. Such a function is, e.g., <code >sqrtArg</code> expecting a reference to a
<code >double</code>, which is modified by calling <code >std::sqrt</code>.
        <pre>
    void sqrtArg(double &amp;arg)
    {
        arg = sqrt(arg);
    }
    template&lt;typename Fun, typename Arg&gt;
    void call(Fun fun, Arg arg)
    {
        fun(arg);
        cout &lt;&lt; "In call: arg = " &lt;&lt; arg &lt;&lt; '\n';
    }
</pre>
<p>
Assuming <code >double value = 3</code> then <code >call(sqrtArg, value)</code> does not modify
<code >value</code> as the compiler infers <code >Arg</code> to be <code >double</code> and hence passes
<code >value</code> by value.
<p>
To have <code >value</code> itself changed the compiler must be informed that <code >value</code>
must be passed by reference. Note that it might not be acceptable to define
<code >call</code>'s template argument as <code >Arg &amp;</code> as <em >not</em> changing the actual
argument might be appropriate in some situations.
<p>
The <a name="an2727"></a><code >ref(arg)</code> and <a name="an2728"></a><code >cref(arg)</code>
 <a name="an2729"></a><em >reference wrappers</em> can be used. They accept an
argument and return it as a (const) reference-typed argument. To actually
change <code >value</code> it can be passed to <code >call</code> using <code >ref(value)</code> as shown in
the following <code >main</code> function:
        <pre>
    int main()
    {
        double value = 3;
        call(sqrtArg, value);
        cout &lt;&lt; "Passed value, returns: " &lt;&lt; value &lt;&lt; '\n';

        call(sqrtArg, ref(value));
        cout &lt;&lt; "Passed ref(value), returns: " &lt;&lt; value &lt;&lt; '\n';
    }
    /*
        Displays:
            In call: arg = 1.73205
            Passed value, returns: 3
            In call: arg = 1.73205
            Passed ref(value), returns: 1.73205
    */
</pre>

<h2 >21.3: Using local and unnamed types as template arguments</h2>
Usually, types have names. But an <a name="an2730"></a><em >anonymous type</em> may also be defined:
        <pre>
    enum
    {
        V1,
        V2,
        V3
    };
</pre>
    Here, the <code >enum</code> defines an <a name="an2731"></a> <em >unnamed</em> or
        <a name="an2732"></a>
    <a name="an2733"></a><em >anonymous type</em>.
<p>
When defining a function template, the compiler normally
deducts the types of its template type parameters from its arguments:
        <pre>
    template &lt;typename T&gt;
    void fun(T &amp;&amp;t);

    fun(3);     // T is int
    fun('c');   // T is char
</pre>
    The following, however, can also be used:
        <pre>
    fun(V1);    // T is a value of the above enum type
</pre>
    Within <code >fun</code> a <code >T</code> variable may be defined, even if it's an anonymous
type:
        <pre>
    template &lt;typename T&gt;
    void fun(T &amp;&amp;t)
    {
        T var(t);
    }
</pre>
<p>
Values or objects of
        <a name="an2734"></a>
    locally defined types may also be passed as arguments to function
templates. E.g.,
        <pre>
    void definer()
    {
        struct Local
        {
            double  dVar;
            int     iVar;
        };
        Local local;            // using a local type

        fun(local);             // OK: T is 'Local'
    }
</pre>
<p>
<a name="TEMPFUNARGS"></a><a name="l497"></a>
<h2 >21.4: Template parameter deduction</h2>
    In this section we concentrate on the process by which the compiler
deduces the actual types of the template type parameters. These types are
deduced when a function template is called using a process called
 <a name="an2735"></a><em >template parameter deduction</em>. As we've already seen, the compiler is
able to substitute a wide range of actual types for a single formal template
type parameter. Even so, not every thinkable conversion is possible. In
particular when a function has multiple parameters of the same template type
parameter, the compiler is very restrictive when determining what argument
types are actually accepted.
<p>
When the compiler deduces the actual types for template type parameters it
<em >only</em> considers the types of the arguments that are actually
used. Neither local variables nor the function's return value is considered in
this process. This is understandable. When a function is called the compiler
is only certain about the types of the function template's arguments. At the
point of the call it definitely does not see the types of the function's local
variables. Also, the function's return value might not actually be used or may
be assigned to a variable of a subrange (or super-range) type of a deduced
template type parameter. So, in the following example, the compiler won't ever
be able to call <code >fun()</code>, as it won't be able to deduce the actual type for
the <code >Type</code> template type parameter.
        <pre>
    template &lt;typename Type&gt;
    Type fun()              // can never be called as `fun()'
    {
        return Type{};
    }
</pre>
    Although the compiler won't be able to handle a call to `<code >fun()</code>', it
<em >is</em> possible to call <code >fun()</code> using an
 <a name="an2736"></a><a name="an2737"></a>explicit type specification. E.g.,
<code >fun&lt;int&gt;()</code> calls <code >fun</code>, instantiated for <code >int</code>. This is of course
<em >not</em> the same as <em >compiler</em> argument deduction.
<p>
In general, when a function has multiple parameters of identical template
type parameters, the actual types must be exactly the same. So, whereas
        <pre>
    void binarg(double x, double y);
</pre>
    may be called using an <code >int</code> and a <code >double</code>, with the <code >int</code> argument
silently being converted to a <code >double</code>, a similar function template cannot
be called using an <code >int</code> and <code >double</code> argument: the compiler won't by
itself promote <code >int</code> to <code >double</code> deciding that <code >Type</code> should be
<code >double</code>:
        <pre>
    template &lt;typename Type&gt;
    void binarg(Type const &amp;p1, Type const &amp;p2)
    {}

    int main()
    {
        binarg(4, 4.5); // ?? won't compile: different actual types
    }
</pre>
<p>
What, then, are the transformations the compiler  applies when deducing
the actual types of template type parameters? It performs but three types
of
        <a name="an2738"></a>
    parameter type transformations and a fourth one to function template
non-type parameters. If it cannot deduce the actual types using these
transformations, the function template will not be considered. The
transformations performed by the compiler are:
    <ul>
    <li> <em >lvalue transformations</em>, creating an <em >rvalue</em> from an
<em >lvalue</em>;
    <li> <em >qualification transformations</em>, inserting a <code >const</code> modifier to
a non-constant argument type;
    <li> <em >transformation to a base class instantiated from a class template</em>,
using a template base class when an argument of a template derived class type
was provided in the call.
    <li> Standard transformations for function template non-type
parameters. This isn't a template type parameter transformation, but it refers
to any remaining template non-type parameter of function templates. For these
function parameters the compiler performs any standard conversion it has
available (e.g., <code >int</code> to <code >size_t</code>, <code >int</code> to <code >double</code>, etc.).
    </ul>
    The purpose of the various template parameter type deduction
transformations is <em >not</em> to match function arguments to function parameters,
but rather, having matched arguments to parameters, to determine the <em >actual
types</em> of the various template type parameters.
<p>
<a name="l498"></a>
<h3 >21.4.1: Lvalue transformations</h3>
    There are three types of <a name="an2739"></a><em >lvalue transformations</em>:
    <ul>
    <li> <strong >lvalue-to-rvalue transformations.</strong>
        <blockquote >An <a name="an2740"></a>lvalue-to-rvalue transformation is applied when an
<code >rvalue</code> is required, but an <code >lvalue</code> is provided.  This happens when a
variable is used as argument to a function specifying a <em >value
parameter</em>. For example,
    <pre>
template&lt;typename Type&gt;
Type negate(Type value)
{
    return -value;
}
int main()
{
    int x = 5;
    x = negate(x);  // lvalue (x) to rvalue (copies x)
}
</pre>
    </blockquote>
    <li> <strong >array-to-pointer transformations.</strong>
        <blockquote >An <a name="an2741"></a>array-to-pointer transformation is applied when the name
of an array is assigned to a pointer variable. This is frequently used with
functions defining pointer parameters.  Such functions frequently receive
arrays as their arguments. The array's address is then assigned to the
pointer-parameter and its type is used to deduce the corresponding template
parameter's type. For example:
    <pre>
template&lt;typename Type&gt;
Type sum(Type *tp, size_t n)
{
    return accumulate(tp, tp + n, Type());
}
int main()
{
    int x[10];
    sum(x, 10);
}
</pre>
    In this example, the location of the array <code >x</code> is passed to <code >sum</code>,
expecting a pointer to some type. Using the array-to-pointer transformation,
<code >x</code>'s address is considered a pointer value which is assigned to <code >tp</code>,
deducing that <code >Type</code> is <code >int</code> in the process.
    </blockquote>
    <li> <strong >function-to-pointer transformations.</strong>
        <blockquote >This transformation is most frequently used with function
templates defining a parameter which is a pointer to a function.  When calling
such a function the name of a function may be specified as its argument. The
address of the function is then assigned to the pointer-parameter, deducing
the template type parameter in the process. This is called a
    <a name="an2742"></a>function-to-pointer transformation. For example:
        <pre>
#include &lt;cmath&gt;

template&lt;typename Type&gt;
void call(Type (*fp)(Type), Type const &amp;value)
{
    (*fp)(value);
}
int main()
{
    call(sqrt, 2.0);
}
</pre>
<p>
In this example, the address of the <code >sqrt</code> function is passed to
<code >call</code>, expecting a pointer to a function returning a <code >Type</code> and expecting
a <code >Type</code> for its argument. Using the function-to-pointer transformation,
<code >sqrt</code>'s address is assigned to <code >fp</code>, deducing that <code >Type</code> is <code >double</code>
in the process (note that <code >sqrt</code> is the <em >address</em> of a function, not a
variable that is a pointer to a function, hence the lvalue
transformation).
<p>
The argument <code >2.0</code> could not have been specified as <code >2</code> as there is no
<code >int sqrt(int)</code> prototype. Furthermore, the function's first parameter
specifies <code >Type (*fp)(Type)</code>, rather than <code >Type (*fp)(Type const &amp;)</code> as
might have been expected from our previous discussion about how to specify the
types of function template's parameters, preferring references over values.
However, <code >fp</code>'s argument <code >Type</code> is not a function template parameter, but
a parameter of the function <code >fp</code> points to. Since <code >sqrt</code> has prototype
<code >double sqrt(double)</code>, rather than <code >double sqrt(double const &amp;)</code>,
<code >call</code>'s parameter <code >fp</code> <em >must</em> be specified as <code >Type
(*fp)(Type)</code>. It's that strict.
    </blockquote>
    </ul>
<p>
<a name="l499"></a>
<h3 >21.4.2: Qualification transformations</h3>
    A <a name="an2743"></a><em >qualification transformation</em> adds <a name="an2744"></a><code >const</code> or <a name="an2745"></a><code >volatile</code>
qualifications to <em >pointers</em>. This transformation is applied when the
function template's type parameter explicitly specifies <code >const</code> (or
<code >volatile</code>) but the function's argument isn't a <code >const</code> or <code >volatile</code>
entity. In that case <code >const</code> or <code >volatile</code> is provided by the compiler.
Subsequently the compiler deduces the template's type parameter. For example:
        <pre>
    template&lt;typename Type&gt;
    Type negate(Type const &amp;value)
    {
        return -value;
    }
    int main()
    {
        int x = 5;
        x = negate(x);
    }
</pre>
    Here we see the function template's <code >Type const &amp;value</code> parameter: a
reference to a <code >const Type</code>. However, the argument isn't a <code >const int</code>,
but an <code >int</code> that can be modified. Applying a qualification transformation,
the compiler adds <code >const</code> to <code >x</code>'s type, and so it matches <code >int const
x</code>.  This is then matched against <code >Type const &amp;value</code> allowing the compiler
to deduce that <code >Type</code> must be <code >int</code>.
<p>
<a name="l500"></a>
<h3 >21.4.3: Transformation to a base class</h3>
    Although the <em >construction</em> of class templates is the topic of chapter
<a href="cplusplus22.html#TEMPCLASS">22</a>, we've already extensively <em >used</em> class templates before. For
example, abstract containers (cf. chapter <a href="cplusplus12.html#CONTAINERS">12</a>) are defined as
class templates.  Class templates can, like
 <a name="an2746"></a><a name="an2747"></a>
    ordinary classes, participate in the construction of class hierarchies.
<p>
In section <a href="cplusplus22.html#DERIVEDTEMPCLASS">22.11</a> it is shown how a <a name="an2748"></a>class template can
be derived from another class template.
<p>
As class template derivation remains to be covered, the following
discussion is necessarily somewhat premature. The reader may of course skip
briefly to section <a href="cplusplus22.html#DERIVEDTEMPCLASS">22.11</a> returning back to this section
thereafter.
<p>
In this section it should be assumed, for the sake of argument, that a
class template <code >Vector</code> has somehow been derived from a <code >std::vector</code>.
Furthermore, assume that the following function template has been
constructed to sort a vector using some function object <code >obj</code>:
        <pre>
    template &lt;typename Type, typename Object&gt;
    void sortVector(std::vector&lt;Type&gt; vect, Object const &amp;obj)
    {
        sort(vect.begin(), vect.end(), obj);
    }
</pre>
    To sort <code >std::vector&lt;string&gt;</code> objects case-insensitively, a <code >class
Caseless</code> could be constructed as follows:
        <pre>
    class CaseLess
    {
        public:
            bool operator()(std::string const &amp;before,
                            std::string const &amp;after) const
            {
                return strcasecmp(before.c_str(), after.c_str()) &lt; 0;
            }
    };
</pre>
    Now various vectors may be sorted using <code >sortVector()</code>:
        <pre>
    int main()
    {
        std::vector&lt;string&gt; vs;
        std::vector&lt;int&gt; vi;

        sortVector(vs, CaseLess());
        sortVector(vi, less&lt;int&gt;());
    }
</pre>
    Applying the transformation
        <a name="an2749"></a>
        <a name="an2750"></a>
    <em >transformation to a base class instantiated from a class template</em>, the
function template <code >sortVector</code> may now also be used to sort <code >Vector</code>
objects. For example:
        <pre>
    int main()
    {
        Vector&lt;string&gt; vs;      // `Vector' instead of `std::vector'
        Vector&lt;int&gt; vi;

        sortVector(vs, CaseLess());
        sortVector(vi, less&lt;int&gt;());
    }
</pre>
    In this example, <code >Vector</code>s were passed as argument to
<code >sortVector</code>. Applying the transformation to a base class instantiated from
a class template, the compiler considers <code >Vector</code> to be a <code >std::vector</code>
enabling it to deduce the template's type parameter. A <code >std::string</code> for the
<code >Vector vs</code>, an <code >int</code> for <code >Vector vi</code>.
<p>
<a name="PARDEDUCT"></a><a name="l501"></a>
<h3 >21.4.4: The template parameter deduction algorithm</h3>
        The compiler uses the following algorithm to deduce the actual types of
        <a name="an2751"></a> its template type parameters:
    <ul>
    <li> In turn, the function template's parameters are identified using the
arguments of the called function.
    <li> For each template parameter used in the function template's parameter
list, the template type parameter is associated with the corresponding
argument's type (e.g., <code >Type</code> is <code >int</code> if the argument is <code >int x</code>, and
the function's parameter is <code >Type &amp;value</code>).
    <li> While matching the argument types to the template type parameters,
the three allowed transformations (see section <a href="cplusplus21.html#TEMPFUNARGS">21.4</a>) for template
type parameters are applied where necessary.
    <li> If identical template type parameters
        <a name="an2752"></a>
    are used with multiple function parameters, the deduced template types
must exactly match. So, the next function template cannot be called with an
<code >int</code> and a <code >double</code> argument:
    <pre>
template &lt;typename Type&gt;
Type add(Type const &amp;lvalue, Type const &amp;rvalue)
{
    return lvalue + rvalue;
}
</pre>
    When calling this function template, two identical types must be used
(albeit that the three standard transformations are of course allowed). If the
template deduction mechanism does not come up with identical actual types for
identical template types, then the function template is not going to be
instantiated.
    </ul>
<p>
<a name="CONTRACTIONS"></a><a name="l502"></a>
<h3 >21.4.5: Template type contractions</h3>
    With function templates the combination of the types of template arguments and
template parameters shows some interesting contractions. What happens, for
example if a template type parameter is specified as an rvalue reference but
an lvalue reference argument type is provided?
<p>
In such cases the compiler performs type contractions. Doubling identical
reference types results in a simple contraction: the type is deduced to be a
single reference type. Example: if the template parameter type is specified as
a <code >Type &amp;&amp;</code> and the actual parameter is an <code >int &amp;&amp;</code> then <code >Type</code> is
deduced to be an <code >int</code>, rather than an <code >int &amp;&amp;</code>.
<p>
This is fairly intuitive. But what happens if the actual type is <code >int &amp;</code>?
There is no such thing as an <code >int &amp; &amp;&amp;param</code> and so the compiler contracts
the double reference by removing the rvalue reference, keeping the lvalue
reference. Here the following rules are applied:
<p>
<blockquote >
    1. A function template parameter defined as an lvalue reference to
    a template's type parameter (e.g., <code >Type &amp;</code>) receiving an lvalue
    reference argument results in a single lvalue reference.
<p>
2. A function template parameter defined as an rvalue reference to a
    template's type parameter (e.g., <code >Type &amp;&amp;</code>) receiving any kind of
    reference argument uses the reference type of the argument.  </blockquote>
Examples:
    <ul>
    <li> When providing an <code >Actual &amp;</code> argument then <code >Type &amp;</code> becomes an
    <code >Actual &amp;</code> and <code >Type</code> is inferred as <code >Actual</code>;
<p>
<li> When providing an <code >Actual &amp;</code> then <code >Type &amp;&amp;</code> becomes an
    <code >Actual &amp;</code> and <code >Type</code> is inferred as <code >Actual</code>;
<p>
<li> When providing an <code >Actual &amp;&amp;</code> then <code >Type &amp;</code> also becomes
    <code >Actual &amp;</code>  and <code >Type</code> is inferred as <code >Actual</code>;
<p>
<li> When providing an <code >Actual &amp;&amp;</code> then <code >Type &amp;&amp;</code>  becomes <code >Actual
    &amp;&amp;</code> and <code >Type</code> is inferred as <code >Actual</code>;
    </ul>
<p>
Let's look at a concrete exampe where contraction occurs. Consider the
following function template where a function parameter is defined as an rvalue
references to some template type parameter:
        <pre>
    template &lt;typename Type&gt;
    void function(Type &amp;&amp;param)
    {
        callee(static_cast&lt;Type &amp;&amp;&gt;(param));
    }
</pre>
 In this situation, when <code >function</code> is called with an (lvalue) argument of
type <code >TP &amp;</code> the template type parameter <code >Type</code> is deduced to be <code >Tp
&amp;</code>. Therefore, <code >Type &amp;&amp;param</code> is instantiated as <code >Tp &amp;param</code>, <code >Type</code>
becomes <code >Tp</code> and the rvalue reference is replaced by an lvalue reference.
<p>
Likewise, when <code >callee</code> is called using the <code >static_cast</code> the same
contraction occurs, so <code >Type &amp;&amp;param</code> operates on <code >Tp &amp;param</code>. Therefore
(using contraction) the static cast <em >also</em> uses type <code >Tp &amp;param</code>. If
<code >param</code> happened to be of type <code >Tp &amp;&amp;</code> then the static cast uses type
<code >Tp &amp;&amp;param</code>.
<p>
This characteristic allows us to pass a function argument to a nested function
<em >without</em> changing its type: lvalues remain lvalues, rvalues remain
rvalues. This characteristic is therefore also known as
 <a name="an2753"></a><em >perfect forwarding</em> which is discussed in greater detail in section
<a href="cplusplus22.html#PERFECT">22.5.2</a>. Perfect forwarding prevents the template author from having to
define multiply overloaded versions of a function template.
<p>
<a name="TEMPFUNDECL"></a><a name="l503"></a>
<h2 >21.5: Declaring function templates</h2>
    Up to now, we've only defined function templates. There are various
 <a name="an2754"></a> consequences of including function
template definitions in multiple source files, none of them serious, but worth
knowing.
    <ul>
    <li> Like class interfaces, template definitions are usually included in
header files. Every time a header file containing a template definition is
read by the compiler it must process the full definition. It must do so even
if it does not actually use the template. This somewhat  slows-down the
compilation. For example, compiling a template header file like <code >algorithm</code>
on my old laptop takes about four times the amount of time it takes to compile
a plain header file like <code >cmath</code>. The header file <code >iostream</code> is even
harder to process, requiring almost 15 times the amount of time it takes to
process <code >cmath</code>. Clearly, processing templates is serious business for the
compiler. On the other hand this drawback shouldn't be taken too seriously.
Compilers are continuously improving their template processing capacity and
computers keep getting faster and faster. What was a nuisance a few years ago
is hardly noticeable today.
    <li> Every time a function template is instantiated, its code appears in
the resulting object module. However, if multiple instantiations of a template
using the same actual types for its template parameters exist in multiple
object files the <a name="an2755"></a><em >one definition rule</em> is lifted.  The linker weeds out
superfluous instantiations (i.e., identical definitions of instantiated
templates). In the final program only one instantiation for a particular set
of actual template type parameters remain available (see section
<a href="cplusplus21.html#TEMPFUNINST">21.6</a> for an illustration). Therefore, the linker has an
additional task to perform (<em >viz.</em> weeding out multiple instantiations),
which somewhat slows down the linking process.
    <li> Sometimes the definitions themselves are <em >not</em> required, but
references or pointers to the templates <em >are</em>. Requiring the compiler to
process the full template definitions in those cases needlessly slows down the
compilation process.
    <li> In the context of <a name="an2756"></a><em >template meta programming</em> (see chapter
<a href="cplusplus23.html#ADVANCEDTEMPL">23</a>) it is sometimes not even required to provide a template
implementation. Instead, only <em >specializations</em> (cf. section
<a href="cplusplus21.html#SPECIALIZING">21.9</a>) are created which are based upon the mere <em >declaration</em>.
    </ul>
    So in some contexts template <em >definitions</em> may not be required.  Instead
the software engineer may opt to <em >declare</em> a template rather than to
include the template's definition time and again in various source files.
<p>
When templates are declared, the compiler does not have to process the
template's definitions again and again; and no instantiations are created
on the basis of template declarations alone. Any actually required
instantiation must then be available elsewhere (of course, this holds true for
declarations in general). Unlike the situation we encounter with ordinary
functions, which are usually stored in libraries, it is currently not possible
to store templates in libraries (although the compiler may construct
<a name="an2757"></a><em >precompiled header</em> <em >files</em>). Consequently, using template declarations
puts a burden on the shoulders of the software engineer, who has to make sure
that the required instantiations exist. Below a simple way to accomplish that
is introduced.
<p>
To create a function template declaration simply replace the function's
body by a semicolon. Note that this is exactly identical to the way ordinary
function declarations are constructed. So, the previously defined function
template <code >add</code> can simply be declared as
        <pre>
    template &lt;typename Type&gt;
    Type add(Type const &amp;lvalue, Type const &amp;rvalue);
</pre>
    We've already encountered <a name="an2758"></a>template declarations. The header file
<code >iosfwd</code> may be included in sources not requiring instantiations of elements
from the class <a name="an2759"></a><code >ios</code> and its derived classes. For example, to compile the
<em >declaration</em>
        <pre>
    std::string getCsvLine(std::istream &amp;in, char const *delim);
</pre>
    it is not necessary to include the <code >string</code> and <code >istream</code> header
files. Rather, a single
        <pre>
    #include &lt;iosfwd&gt;
</pre>
    is sufficient. Processing <code >iosfwd</code> requires only a fraction of the time
it takes to process the <code >string</code> and <code >istream</code> header files.
<p>

<h3 >21.5.1: Instantiation declarations</h3>
        If declaring function templates speeds up the compilation and the linking
phases of a program, how can we make sure that the required instantiations of
the function templates are available when the program is eventually linked
together?
<p>
For this a variant of a template declaration is available, a so-called
 <a name="an2760"></a><a name="an2761"></a><em >explicit instantiation declaration</em>.
    An explicit instantiation declaration consists of the following elements:
    <ul>
    <li> It starts with the keyword <code >template</code>, omitting the template
parameter list.
    <li> Next the function template's return type and name are specified.
    <li> The function template's name is followed by a <em >type specification
list</em>. A type specification list is an angle brackets enclosed list of type
names.  Each type specifies the actual type of the corresponding template type
parameter in the template's parameter list.
    <li> Finally the function template's parameter list is specified,
terminated by a semicolon.
    </ul>
    Although this is a declaration, it is understood by the compiler as a
request to instantiate that particular variant of the function template.
<p>
Using explicit instantiation declarations all instantiations of template
functions required by a program can be collected in one file. This file, which
should be a normal <em >source</em> file, should include the template definition
header file and should subsequently specify the required explicit
instantiation declarations. Since it's a source file, it is not included
by other sources. So namespace <code >using</code> directives and declarations may
safely be used once the required headers have been included.  Here is an
example showing the required instantiations for our earlier <code >add</code> function
template, instantiated for <code >double</code>, <code >int</code>, and <code >std::string</code> types:
        <pre>
    #include "add.h"
    #include &lt;string&gt;
    using namespace std;

    template int add&lt;int&gt;(int const &amp;lvalue, int const &amp;rvalue);
    template double add&lt;double&gt;(double const &amp;lvalue, double const &amp;rvalue);
    template string add&lt;string&gt;(string const &amp;lvalue, string const &amp;rvalue);
</pre>
    If we're sloppy and forget to mention an instantiation required by our
program then the repair is easily made by adding the missing instantiation
declaration to the above list. After recompiling the file and relinking the
program we're done.
<p>
<a name="TEMPFUNINST"></a><a name="l505"></a>
<h2 >21.6: Instantiating function templates</h2>
    Different from an ordinary function that results in code once the compiler
reads its definition a template is not instantiated when its definition is
read. A template is merely a <em >recipe</em> telling the compiler how to create
particular code once it's time to do so. It's indeed very much like a recipe
in a cooking book. You reading how to bake a cake doesn't mean you have
actually baked that cake by the time you've read the recipe.
<p>
So, when is a function template actually instantiated? There are two
situations where the compiler decides to instantiate templates:
    <ul>
    <li> They are instantiated when they are used (e.g., the function
<code >add</code> is called with a pair of <code >size_t</code> values);
    <li> When addresses of function templates are taken they are instantiated.
Example:
        <pre>
char (*addptr)(char const &amp;, char const &amp;) = add;
</pre>
    </ul>
    The location of statements causing the compiler to instantiate a template
is called the template's
        <a name="an2762"></a>
    <a name="an2763"></a><em >point of instantiation</em>. The point of instantiation has serious
implications for the function template's code. These implications are
discussed in section <a href="cplusplus21.html#NAMERESFUN">21.13</a>.
<p>
The compiler is not always able to deduce the template's type parameters
unambiguously. When the compiler reports an ambiguity it must be solved by the
software engineer. Consider the following code:
        <pre>
    #include &lt;iostream&gt;
    #include "add.h"

    size_t fun(int (*f)(int *p, size_t n));
    double fun(double (*f)(double *p, size_t n));

    int main()
    {
        std::cout &lt;&lt; fun(add);
    }
</pre>
<p>
When this little program is compiled, the compiler reports an ambiguity it
cannot resolve. It has two candidate functions as for each overloaded version
of <code >fun</code> an <code >add</code> function can be instantiated:
        <pre>
    error: call of overloaded 'fun(&lt;unknown type&gt;)' is ambiguous
    note: candidates are: int fun(size_t (*)(int*, size_t))
    note:                 double fun(double (*)(double*, size_t))
</pre>
    Such situations should of course be avoided. Function templates can only
be instantiated if there's no ambiguity. Ambiguities arise when multiple
functions emerge from the compiler's function selection mechanism (see section
<a href="cplusplus21.html#FUNCTIONSELECTION">21.14</a>). It is up to us to resolve the ambiguities. They
<em >could</em> be resolved using a blunt <a name="an2764"></a><code >static_cast</code> (by which we select among
alternatives, all of them possible and available):
        <pre>
    #include &lt;iostream&gt;
    #include "add.h"

    int fun(int (*f)(int const &amp;lvalue, int const &amp;rvalue));
    double fun(double (*f)(double const &amp;lvalue, double const &amp;rvalue));

    int main()
    {
        std::cout &lt;&lt; fun(
                        static_cast&lt;int (*)(int const &amp;, int const &amp;)&gt;(add)
                    );
    }
</pre>
<p>
But it's good practice to avoid type casts wherever possible. How to do
this is explained in the next section (<a href="cplusplus21.html#TEMPFUNEXPLICIT">21.7</a>).
<p>
<a name="l506"></a>
<h3 >21.6.1: Instantiations: no `code bloat'</h3>
        As mentioned in section <a href="cplusplus21.html#TEMPFUNDECL">21.5</a>, the linker removes
 <a name="an2765"></a> identical
instantiations of a template from the final program, leaving only one
instantiation for each unique set of actual template type parameters. To
illustrate the linker's behavior we do as follows:
    <ul>
    <li> First we construct several source files:
            <ul>
            <li><code >source1.cc</code> defines a function <code >fun</code>, instantiating
<code >add</code> for <code >int</code>-type arguments, including <code >add</code>'s template
definition. It displays <code >add</code>'s address:
        <pre>
    union PointerUnion
    {
        int (*fp)(int const &amp;, int const &amp;);
        void *vp;
    };
</pre>
<p>
<pre>
    #include &lt;iostream&gt;
    #include "add.h"
    #include "pointerunion.h"

    void fun()
    {
        PointerUnion pu = { add };

        std::cout &lt;&lt; pu.vp &lt;&lt; '\n';
    }
</pre>
<p>
<li><code >source2.cc</code> defines the same function, but merely declares the
proper <code >add</code> template using a template declaration (<em >not</em> an instantiation
declaration). Here is <code >source2.cc</code>:
        <pre>
    #include &lt;iostream&gt;
    #include "pointerunion.h"

    template&lt;typename Type&gt;
    Type add(Type const &amp;, Type const &amp;);

    void fun()
    {
        PointerUnion pu = { add };

        std::cout &lt;&lt; pu.vp &lt;&lt; '\n';
    }
</pre>
<p>
<li><code >main.cc</code> again includes <code >add</code>'s template definition,
declares the function <code >fun</code> and defines <code >main</code>, defining <code >add</code>
for <code >int</code>-type arguments as well and displaying <code >add</code>'s function
address. It also calls the function <code >fun</code>. Here is <code >main.cc</code>:
        <pre>
    #include &lt;iostream&gt;
    #include "add.h"
    #include "pointerunion.h"

    void fun();

    int main()
    {
        PointerUnion pu = { add };

        fun();
        std::cout &lt;&lt; pu.vp &lt;&lt; '\n';
    }
</pre>
<p>
</ul>
    <li> All sources are compiled to object modules. Note the different sizes
of <code >source1.o</code> (1912 bytes using <code >g++</code> version 4.3.4 (sizes of object
modules reported in this section may differ for different compilers and/or
run-time libraries)) and <code >source2.o</code> (1740 bytes). Since <code >source1.o</code>
contains the instantiation of <code >add</code>, it is somewhat larger than
<code >source2.o</code>, containing only the template's declaration. Now we're ready to
start our little experiment.
    <li> Linking <code >main.o</code> and <code >source1.o</code>, we obviously link together two
object modules, each containing its own instantiation of the same template
function. The resulting program produces the following output:
        <pre>
    0x80486d8
    0x80486d8
</pre>
        Furthermore, the size of the resulting program is 6352 bytes.
    <li> Linking <code >main.o</code> and <code >source2.o</code>, we now link together an object
module containing the instantiation of the <code >add</code> template, and another
object module containing the mere declaration of the same template
function. So, the resulting program cannot but contain a single instantiation
of the required function template. This program has exactly the same size, and
produces exactly the same output as the first program.
    </ul>
    From our little experiment we conclude that the linker indeed removes
identical template instantiations from a final program. Furthermore we
conclude that using mere template declarations does not result in template
instantiations.

<h2 >21.7: Using explicit template types</h2>
    In the previous section we saw that the compiler may encounter ambiguities
when attempting to instantiate a template. In an example overloaded versions
of a function (<code >fun</code>) existed, expecting different types of arguments. The
ambiguity resulted from the fact that both arguments could have been provided
by an instantiation of a function template. The intuitive way to solve such an
ambiguity is to use a <code >static_cast</code>. But casts should be avoided wherever
possible.
<p>
With function templates static casts may indeed be avoided using
 <a name="an2766"></a><em >explicit template type arguments</em>. Explicit template type arguments can
be used to inform the compiler about the actual types it should use when
instantiating a template. To use explicit type arguments the function's name
is followed by an <em >actual template type argument list</em> which may again be
followed by the function's argument list. The actual types mentioned in the
actual template argument list are used by the compiler to `deduce' what types
to use when instantiating the template. Here is the example from the previous
section, now using explicit template type arguments:
        <pre>
    #include &lt;iostream&gt;
    #include "add.h"

    int fun(int (*f)(int const &amp;lvalue, int const &amp;rvalue));
    double fun(double (*f)(double const &amp;lvalue, double const &amp;rvalue));

    int main()
    {
        std::cout &lt;&lt; fun(add&lt;int&gt;) &lt;&lt; '\n';
    }
</pre>
<p>
Explicit template type arguments  can be used in situations where the
compiler has no way to detect which types should actually be used. E.g., in
section <a href="cplusplus21.html#TEMPFUNARGS">21.4</a> the function template <code >Type fun()</code> was defined. To
instantiate this function for the <code >double</code> type, we can call
<code >fun&lt;double&gt;()</code>.
<p>
<a name="l508"></a>
<h2 >21.8: Overloading function templates</h2>
Let's once again look at our <code >add</code> template. That template was designed to
return the sum of two entities. If we would want to compute the sum of three
entities, we could write:
        <pre>
    int main()
    {
        add(add(2, 3), 4);
    }
</pre>
    This is an acceptable solution for the occasional situation. However, if
we would have to add three entities regularly, an <em >overloaded</em> version of
the <code >add</code> function expecting three arguments might be a useful function to
have. There's a simple solution to this problem: function templates may be
        <a name="an2767"></a>
        <a name="an2768"></a>
overloaded.
<p>
To define an overloaded function template, merely put multiple definitions
of the template in its header file. For the <code >add</code> function this would boil
down to:
        <pre>
    template &lt;typename Type&gt;
    Type add(Type const &amp;lvalue, Type const &amp;rvalue)
    {
        return lvalue + rvalue;
    }
    template &lt;typename Type&gt;
    Type add(Type const &amp;lvalue, Type const &amp;mvalue, Type const &amp;rvalue)
    {
        return lvalue + mvalue + rvalue;
    }
</pre>
    The overloaded function does not have to be defined in terms of simple
values. Like all overloaded functions, a unique set of function parameters is
enough to define an overloaded function template. For example, here's an
overloaded version that can be used to compute the sum of the elements of a
vector:
        <pre>
    template &lt;typename Type&gt;
    Type add(std::vector&lt;Type&gt; const &amp;vect)
    {
        return accumulate(vect.begin(), vect.end(), Type());
    }
</pre>
<p>
When overloading function templates we do not have to restrict ourselves
to the function's parameter list. The template's type parameter list itself
may also be
        <a name="an2769"></a>
    overloaded. The last definition of the <code >add</code> template allows us to
specify a <code >vector</code> as its first argument, but no <code >deque</code> or
<code >map</code>. Overloaded versions for those types of containers could of course be
constructed, but how far should we go? A better approach seems to be to look
for common characteristics of these containers. If found we may be able to
define an overloaded function template based on these common
characteristics. One common characteristic of the mentioned containers is that
they all support <code >begin</code> and <code >end</code> members, returning iterators. Using
this, we could define a template type parameter representing containers that
must support these members. But mentioning a plain `container type' doesn't
tell us for what type of data it was instantiated. So we need a second
template type parameter representing the container's data type, thus
overloading the template's type parameter list. Here is the resulting
overloaded version of the <code >add</code> template:
        <pre>
    template &lt;typename Container, typename Type&gt;
    Type add(Container const &amp;cont, Type const &amp;init)
    {
        return std::accumulate(cont.begin(), cont.end(), init);
    }
</pre>
    One may wonder whether the <code >init</code> parameter could not be left out of the
parameter list as <code >init</code> often has a default initialization value. The
answer is `yes', but there are complications. It <em >is</em> possible to define the
<code >add</code> function as follows:
        <pre>
    template &lt;typename Type, typename Container&gt;
    Type add(Container const &amp;cont)
    {
        return std::accumulate(cont.begin(), cont.end(), Type());
    }
</pre>
    Note, however, that the template's type parameters were reordered, which
is necessary because the compiler won't be able to determine <code >Type</code> in a
call like:
        <pre>
    int x = add(vectorOfInts);
</pre>
    After reordering the template type parameters, putting <code >Type</code> first, an
explicit template type argument can be provided for the first template type
parameter:
        <pre>
    int x = add&lt;int&gt;(vectorOfInts);
</pre>
    In this example we provided a <code >vector&lt;int&gt;</code> argument. One might wonder
why we have to specify <code >int</code> explicitly to allow the compiler to determine
the template type parameter <code >Type</code>. In fact, we don't. A third kind of
template parameter exists, a <em >template template parameter</em>, allowing the
compiler to determine <code >Type</code> directly from the actual container
argument. Template template parameters are discussed in section
<a href="cplusplus23.html#TEMPTEMPPAR">23.4</a>.
<p>
<a name="l509"></a>
<h3 >21.8.1: An example using overloaded function templates</h3>
        With all these overloaded versions in place, we may now start the compiler
to compile the following function:
        <pre>
    using namespace std;

    int main()
    {
        vector&lt;int&gt; v;

        add(3, 4);          // 1 (see text)
        add(v);             // 2
        add(v, 0);          // 3
    }
</pre>
    <ul>
    <li> In statement 1 the compiler recognizes two identical types, both
<code >int</code>. It therefore instantiates <code >add&lt;int&gt;</code>, our very first definition
of the <code >add</code> template.
    <li> In statement 2 a single argument is used. Consequently, the compiler
looks for an overloaded version of <code >add</code> requiring but one argument. It
finds the overloaded function template expecting a <code >std::vector</code>, deducing
that the template's type parameter must be <code >int</code>. It instantiates
        <pre>
    add&lt;int&gt;(std::vector&lt;int&gt; const &amp;)
</pre>
    <li> In statement 3 the compiler again encounters an argument list having
  two arguments. However, this time the types of the arguments aren't equal,
so <code >add</code> template's first definition can't be used. But it <em >can</em> use the
last definition, expecting entities having different types. As a
<code >std::vector</code> supports <code >begin</code> and <code >end</code>, the compiler is now able to
instantiate the function template
        <pre>
add&lt;std::vector&lt;int&gt;, int&gt;(std::vector&lt;int&gt; const &amp;, int const &amp;)
</pre>
    </ul>
    Having defined the <code >add</code> function template for two equal and two
different template type parameters we've exhausted the possibilities for using
an <code >add</code> function template having two template type parameters.
<p>
<a name="l510"></a>
<h3 >21.8.2: Ambiguities when overloading function templates</h3>
    Although it <em >is</em> possible to define another function template <code >add</code> this
introduces an ambiguity as the compiler won't be able to choose which of
the two overloaded versions defining two differently typed function parameters
should be used. For example when defining:
        <pre>
    #include "add.h"

    template &lt;typename T1, typename T2&gt;
    T1 add(T1 const &amp;lvalue, T2 const &amp;rvalue)
    {
        return lvalue + rvalue;
    }
    int main()
    {
        add(3, 4.5);
    }
</pre>
    the compiler reports an ambiguity like the following:
        <pre>
        error: call of overloaded `add(int, double)' is ambiguous
        error: candidates are: Type add(const Container&amp;, const Type&amp;)
                                    [with Container = int, Type = double]
        error:                 T1 add(const T1&amp;, const T2&amp;)
                                    [with T1 = int, T2 = double]
</pre>
    Now recall the overloaded function template accepting three arguments:
        <pre>
    template &lt;typename Type&gt;
    Type add(Type const &amp;lvalue, Type const &amp;mvalue, Type const &amp;rvalue)
    {
        return lvalue + mvalue + rvalue;
    }
</pre>
    It may be considered as a disadvantage that only equally typed arguments
are accepted by this function (three <code >int</code>s, three <code >double</code>s, etc.). To
remedy this we define yet another overloaded function template, this time
accepting arguments of any type.  This function template can only be used if
<code >operator+</code> is defined between the function's actually used types, but apart
from that there appears to be no problem. Here is the overloaded version
accepting arguments of any type:
        <pre>
    template &lt;typename Type1, typename Type2, typename Type3&gt;
    Type1 add(Type1 const &amp;lvalue, Type2 const &amp;mvalue, Type3 const &amp;rvalue)
    {
        return lvalue + mvalue + rvalue;
    }
</pre>
    Now that we've defined the above two overloaded function templates
expecting three arguments let's call <code >add</code> as follows:
        <pre>
    add(1, 2, 3);
</pre>
    Should we expect an ambiguity here? After all, the compiler might select
the former function, deducing that <code >Type == int</code>, but it might also select
the latter function, deducing that <code >Type1 == int, Type2 == int</code> and <code >Type3
== int</code>. Remarkably, the compiler reports no ambiguity.
<p>
No ambiguity is reported because of the following. If overloaded template
functions are defined using <em >less</em> and <em >more</em> specialized template type
parameters (e.g., less specialized: all types different vs. more specialized:
        <a name="an2770"></a> all types equal)
then the compiler selects the more specialized function whenever possible.
<p>
As a <a name="an2771"></a>rule of thumb: overloaded function templates must allow a unique
combination of template type arguments to be specified to prevent ambiguities
when selecting which overloaded function template to instantiate.  The
<em >ordering</em> of template type parameters in the function template's type
parameter list is not important. E.g., trying to instantiate one of the
following function templates results in an ambiguity:
        <pre>
    template &lt;typename T1, typename T2&gt;
    void binarg(T1 const &amp;first, T2 const &amp;second)
    {}
    template &lt;typename T1, typename T2&gt;
    void binarg(T2 const &amp;first, T1 const &amp;second)
    {}
</pre>
    This should not come as a surprise. After all, template type parameters
are just formal names. Their names (<code >T1</code>, <code >T2</code> or <code >Whatever</code>) have no
concrete meanings.
<p>
<a name="l511"></a>
<h3 >21.8.3: Declaring overloaded function templates</h3>
        Like any function, overloaded functions may be declared, either using
plain declarations or instantiation declarations. Explicit template argument
types may also be used. Example:
    <ul>
    <li> To declare a function template <code >add</code> accepting certain containers:
    <pre>
template &lt;typename Container, typename Type&gt;
Type add(Container const &amp;container, Type const &amp;init);
</pre>
    <li> to use an instantiation declaration (in which case the compiler must
already have seen the template's definition):
    <pre>
template int add&lt;std::vector&lt;int&gt;, int&gt;
                (std::vector&lt;int&gt; const &amp;vect, int const &amp;init);
</pre>
    <li> to use explicit template type arguments:
    <pre>
std::vector&lt;int&gt; vi;
int sum = add&lt;std::vector&lt;int&gt;, int&gt;(vi, 0);
</pre>
    </ul>
<p>
<a name="SPECIALIZING"></a><a name="l512"></a>
<h2 >21.9: Specializing templates for deviating types</h2>
    The initial <code >add</code> template, defining two identically typed parameters
works fine for all types supporting <code >operator+</code> and a copy
constructor. However, these assumptions are not always met. For example, with
<code >char *</code>s, using <code >operator+</code> or a `copy constructor' does not make
sense. The compiler tries to instantiate the function template, but
compilation fails as  <code >operator+</code> is not defined for pointers.
<p>
In such situations the compiler may be able to resolve the template type
parameters but it (or we ...) may then detect that the standard implementation
is pointless or produces errors.
<p>
To solve this problem a <a name="an2772"></a><em >template explicit specialization</em> may be
defined.  A template explicit specialization defines the function template for
which a generic definition already exists using specific actual template type
parameters. As we saw in the previous section the compiler always prefers
a more specialized function over a less specialized one. So the template
explicit specialization is selected whenever possible.
<p>
A template explicit specialization offers a specialization for its template
type parameter(s). The special type is consistently subsituted for
the template type parameter in the function template's code. For
example if the explicitly specialized type is <code >char const *</code> then in the
template definition
        <pre>
    template &lt;typename Type&gt;
    Type add(Type const &amp;lvalue, Type const &amp;rvalue)
    {
        return lvalue + rvalue;
    }
</pre>
    <code >Type</code> must be replaced by <code >char const *</code>, resulting in a function
having prototype
        <pre>
    char const *add(char const *const &amp;lvalue, char const *const &amp;rvalue);
</pre>
    Now we try to use this function:
        <pre>
    int main(int argc, char **argv)
    {
        add(argv[0], argv[1]);
    }
</pre>
    However, the compiler ignores our specialization and tries to instantiate
the initial function template. This fails, leaving us wondering why it didn't
select the explicit specialization....
<p>
To see what happened here we replay, step by step, the compiler's actions:
    <ul>
    <li> <code >add</code> is called with <code >char *</code> arguments.
    <li> Both types are equal, so the compiler deduces that <code >Type</code> equals
<code >char *</code>.
    <li> Now it inspects the specialization. Can a <code >char *</code> template type
argument match a <code >char const *const &amp;</code> template parameter? Here
opportunities for the allowable transformations from section <a href="cplusplus21.html#TEMPFUNARGS">21.4</a>
may arise. A qualification transformation seems to be the only viable one,
allowing the compiler to bind a const-parameter to a non-const argument.
    <li> So, in terms of <code >Type</code> the compiler can match an argument of some
<code >Type</code> or an argument of some <code >Type const</code> to a <code >Type const &amp;</code>.
    <li> <code >Type</code> itself is not modified, and so <code >Type</code> is a <code >char *</code>.
    <li> Next the compiler inspects the available explicit specializations. It
finds one, specializing for <code >char const *</code>.
    <li> Since a <code >char const *</code> is not a <code >char *</code> it rejects the explicit
specialization and uses the generic form, resulting in a compilation error.
    </ul>
    If our <code >add</code> function template should also be able to handle <code >char *</code>
template type arguments another explicit specialization for <code >char *</code> may be
required, resulting in the prototype
        <pre>
    char *add(char *const &amp;lvalue, char *const &amp;rvalue);
</pre>
<p>
Instead of defining another explicit specialization an <em >overloaded</em>
function template could be designed expecting pointers. The following function
template definition expects two pointers to constant <code >Type</code> values and
returns a pointer to a non-constant <code >Type</code>:
        <pre>
    template &lt;typename Type&gt;
    Type *add(Type const *t1, Type const *t2)
    {
        std::cout &lt;&lt; "Pointers\n";
        return new Type;
    }
</pre>
    What actual types may be bound to the above function parameters? In this
case only a <code >Type const *</code>, allowing <code >char const *</code>'s to be passed as
arguments. There's no opportunity for a qualification transformation here.
The qualification transformation allows the compiler to add a <code >const</code> to a
non-const argument if the parameter itself (and <em >not</em>  <code >Type</code>) is
specified in terms of a <code >const</code> or <code >const &amp;</code>. Loooking at, e.g., <code >t1</code> we
see that it's defined as a <code >Type const *</code>. There's nothing <code >const</code> here
that's referring to the parameter (in which case it would have been <code >Type
const *const t1</code> or <code >Type const *const &amp;t1</code>). Consequently a qualification
transformation cannot be applied here.
<p>
As the above overloaded function template only accepts <code >char const *</code>
arguments, it will not accept (without a reinterpret cast) <code >char *</code>
arguments. So <code >main</code>'s <code >argv</code> elements cannot be passed to our overloaded
function template.
<p>
<a name="l513"></a>
<h3 >21.9.1: Avoiding too many specializations</h3>
        So do we have to define yet another overloaded function template, this
time expecting <code >Type *</code> arguments? It is possible, but at some point it
should become clear that our approach doesn't scale. Like ordinary functions
and classes, function templates should have one conceptually clear
purpose. Trying to add overloaded function templates to overloaded function
templates quickly turns the template into a kludge. Don't use this approach. A
better approach is to construct the template so that it fits its original
purpose, to make allowances for the occasional specific case and to describe
its purpose clearly in its documentation.
<p>
In some situations constructing template explicit specialization may of
course be defensible. Two specializations for <code >const</code> and non-<code >const</code>
pointers to characters might be appropriate for our <code >add</code> function
template. <a name="an2773"></a> Here's how they are
constructed:
    <ul>
    <li> Start with the keyword <code >template</code>.
    <li> Next, an empty set of angle brackets is written. This indicates to
the compiler that there must be an <em >existing</em> template whose prototype
matches the one we're about to define. If we err and there is no such template
        <a name="an2774"></a>
then the compiler reports an error like:
        <pre>
    error: template-id `add&lt;char*&gt;' for `char* add(char* const&amp;, char*
           const&amp;)' does not match any template declaration
</pre>
    <li> Now the function's head is defined. It must match the prototype of
the initial function template or the form of a template explicit instantiation
declaration (see section <a href="cplusplus21.html#TEMPFUNEXDEC">21.5.1</a>) if its specialized type cannot be
determined from the function's arguments. It must specify the correct
returntype, function name, maybe explicit template type arguments, as well as
the function's parameter list.
    <li> Finally the function's body is defined, providing the special
implementation that is required for the specialization.
    </ul>
<p>
Here are two explicit specializations for the function template <code >add</code>,
expecting <code >char *</code> and <code >char const *</code> arguments:
        <pre>
    template &lt;&gt; char *add&lt;char *&gt;(char *const &amp;p1,
                                        char *const &amp;p2)
    {
        std::string str(p1);
        str += p2;
        return strcpy(new char[str.length() + 1], str.c_str());
    }

    template &lt;&gt; char const *add&lt;char const *&gt;(char const *const &amp;p1,
                                        char const *const &amp;p2)
    {
        static std::string str;
        str = p1;
        str += p2;
        return str.c_str();
    }
</pre>
    Template explicit specializations are normally included in the file
containing the other function template's implementations.
<p>
<a name="l514"></a>
<h3 >21.9.2: Declaring specializations</h3>
        Template explicit specializations can be declared in the usual way. I.e.,
by replacing its body with a semicolon.
<p>
When <em >declaring</em> a template explicit specialization the pair of
 <a name="an2775"></a>angle brackets following the <code >template</code> keyword are essential. If
omitted, we would have constructed a
        <a name="an2776"></a>template instantiation declaration.
    The compiler would silently process it, at the expense of a somewhat
longer compilation time.
<p>
When declaring a template explicit specialization (or when using an
instantiation declaration) the
        <a name="an2777"></a>
    explicit specification of the template type parameters can be omitted if
the compiler is able to deduce these types from the function's arguments.  As
this is the case with the <code >char (const) *</code> specializations, they could also
be declared as follows:
        <pre>
    template &lt;&gt; char *add(char *const &amp;p1, char *const &amp;p2)
    template &lt;&gt; char const *add(char const *const &amp;p1,
                                char const *const &amp;p2);
</pre>
    If in addition <code >template &lt;&gt;</code> could be omitted the template character
would be removed from the declaration. The resulting declaration is now a mere
function declaration. This is not an error: function templates and ordinary
(non-template) functions may mutually overload each other. Ordinary functions
are not as restrictive as function templates with respect to allowed type
conversions. This could be a reason to overload a template with an ordinary
function every once in a while.
<p>
A function template explicit specialization is not just another overloaded
        <a name="an2778"></a> version of
the function template. Whereas an overloaded version may define a completely
different set of template parameters, a specialization must use the same set
of template parameters as its non-specialized variant. The compiler uses the
specialization in situations where the actual template arguments match the
types defined by the specialization (following the rule that the most
specialized set of parameters matching a set of arguments will be
used). For different sets of parameters  overloaded versions of functions (or
function templates) must be used.
<p>
<a name="l515"></a>
<h3 >21.9.3: Complications when using the insertion operator</h3>
        Now that we've covered explicit specializations and overloading let's
consider what happens when a class defines a <code >std::string</code> conversion
operator (cf. section <a href="cplusplus11.html#ConversionOperators">11.3</a>).
<p>
A conversion operator is guaranteed to be used as an rvalue. This means that
objects of a class defining a <code >string</code> conversion operator can be assigned
to, e.g., <code >string</code> objects. But when trying to insert objects defining
<code >string</code> conversion operators into streams then the compiler complains that
we're attemping to insert an inappropriate type into an <code >ostream</code>.
<p>
On the other hand, when this class defines an <code >int</code> conversion operator
insertion is performed flawlessly.
<p>
The reason for this distinction is that <code >operator&lt;&lt;</code> is defined as a plain
(free) function when inserting a basic type (like <code >int</code>) but it is defined
as a function template when inserting a <code >string</code>. Hence, when trying to
insert an object of our class defining a <code >string</code> conversion operator the
compiler visits all overloaded versions of insertion operators inserting into
<code >ostream</code> objects.
<p>
Since no basic type conversion is available the basic type insertion operators
can't be used. Since the available conversions for template arguments do not
allow the compiler to look for conversion operators our class defining the
<code >string</code> conversion operator cannot be inserted into an <code >ostream</code>.
<p>
If it should be possible to insert objects of such a class into <code >ostream</code>
objects the class must define its own overloaded insertion operator (in
addition to the <code >string</code> conversion operator that was required to use the
class's objects as rvalue in <code >string</code> assignments).
<p>
<a name="STATICASSERT"></a><a name="l516"></a>
<h2 >21.10: Static assertions</h2>
The <a name="an2779"></a>
        <pre>
    static_assert(constant expression, error message)
</pre>
    utility is available to allow assertions to be made from inside template
definitions. Here are two examples of its use:
        <pre>
    static_assert(BUFSIZE1 == BUFSIZE2,
                                "BUFSIZE1 and BUFSIZE2 must be equal");

    template &lt;typename Type1, typename Type2&gt;
    void rawswap(Type1 &amp;type1, Type2 &amp;type2)
    {
        static_assert(sizeof(Type1) == sizeof(Type2),
                        "rawswap: Type1 and Type2 must have equal sizes");
        // ...
    }
</pre>
    The first example shows how to avoid yet another preprocessor directive
        <a name="an2780"></a>
 (in this case the <a name="an2781"></a><code >#error</code> directive).
<p>
The second example shows how <code >static_assert</code> can be used to ensure that
a template operates under the right condition(s).
<p>
The string defined in <code >static_assert</code>'s second argument is displayed and
compilation stops if the condition specified in <code >static_assert</code>'s first
argument is <code >false</code>.
<p>
Like the <code >#error</code> preprocessor directive <code >static_assert</code> is a
<a name="an2782"></a>compile-time matter that doesn't have any effect on the <a name="an2783"></a>run-time
efficiency of the code in which it is used.
<p>
<a name="l517"></a>
<h2 >21.11: Numeric limits</h2>
The header file <a name="an2784"></a><code >&lt;climits&gt;</code> defines constants for various types, e.g.,
<a name="an2785"></a><code >INT_MAX</code> defines the maximum value that can be stored in an <code >int</code>.
<p>
The disadvantage of the limits defined in <code >climits</code> is that they are fixed
limits. Let's assume you write a function template that receives an argument
of a certain type. E.g,
        <pre>
    template&lt;typename Type&gt;
    Type operation(Type &amp;&amp;type);
</pre>
    Assume this function should return the largest negative value for <code >Type</code>
if <code >type</code> is a negative value and the largest positive value if <code >type</code> is
a positive value. However, 0 should be returned if the type is not an integral
value.
<p>
How to proceed?
<p>
Since the constants in <code >climits</code> can only be used if the type to use is
already known, the only approach seems to be to create function template
specializations for the various integral types, like:
        <pre>
    template&lt;&gt;
    int operation&lt;int&gt;(int &amp;&amp;type)
    {
        return type &lt; 0 ? INT_MIN : INT_MAX;
    }
</pre>
<p>
The facilities provided by <a name="an2786"></a>numeric_limits provide an alternative. To use
these facilities the header file <a name="an2787"></a><code >&lt;limits&gt;</code> header file must be included.
<p>
The class template <code >numeric_limits</code> offers various members answering all
kinds of questions that could be asked of numeric types. Before introducing
these members, let's have a look at how we could implement the <code >operation</code>
function template as just one single function template:
        <pre>
    template&lt;typename Type&gt;
    Type operation(Type &amp;&amp;type)
    {
        return
            not numeric_limits&lt;Type&gt;::is_integer ? 0 :
            type &lt; 0 ? numeric_limits&lt;Type&gt;::min() :
                       numeric_limits&lt;Type&gt;::max();
    }
</pre>
    Now <code >operation</code> can be used for all the language's primitive types.
<p>
Here is an overview of the facilities offered by <code >numeric_limits</code>. Note
that the member functions defined by <code >numeric_limits</code> return <code >constexpr</code>
values. A member `<code >member</code>' defined by <code >numeric_limits</code> for type <code >Type</code>
can be used as follows:
        <pre>
    numeric_limits&lt;Type&gt;::member    // data members
    numeric_limits&lt;Type&gt;::member()  // member functions
</pre>
    All <code >numeric_limits</code> member functions return <code >constexpr</code> values.

<h2 >21.12: Polymorphous wrappers for function objects</h2>
In <strong >C++</strong> pointers to (member) functions have fairly strict rvalues. They can
only point to functions matching their types.  This becomes a problem when
defining templates where the type of a function pointer may depend on the
template's parameters.
<p>
To solve this problem 
        <a name="an2827"></a>
        <a name="an2828"></a>
    <em >polymorphous (function object) wrappers</em> can be used.  Polymorphous
wrappers refer to function pointers, member functions or function objects, as
long as their parameters match in type and number.
<p>
Before using polymorphic function wrappers the header file `<a name="an2829"></a><code >&lt;functional&gt;</code>'
must be included.
<p>
Polymorphic function wrappers are made available through the
<code >std::function</code><a name="an2830"></a>  class template. Its template argument
is the prototype of the function to create a wrapper for. Here is an example
of the definition of a polymorphic function wrapper that can be used to point
to a function expecting two <code >int</code> values and returning an <code >int</code>:
        <pre>
    std::function&lt;int (int, int)&gt; ptr2fun;
</pre>
    Here, the template's parameter is <code >int (int, int)</code>, indicating a
function expecting two <code >int</code> arguments, and returning and <code >int</code>. Other
prototypes return other, matching, function wrappers.
<p>
Such a function wrapper can now be used to point to any function the wrapper
was created for. E.g., `<code >plus&lt;int&gt; add</code>' creates a functor defining an
<code >int operator()(int, int)</code> function call member. As this qualifies as a
function having prototype <code >int (int, int)</code>, our <code >ptr2fun</code> may point to
<code >add</code>:
        <pre>
    ptr2fun = add;
</pre>
<p>
If <code >ptr2fun</code> does not yet point to a function (e.g., it is merely
defined) and an attempt is made to call a function through it a
        <a name="an2831"></a>`<code >std::bad_function_call</code>'
    exception is thrown. Also, a polymorphic function wrapper that hasn't been
assigned to a function's address represents the value <code >false</code> in logical
expressions (as if it had been a pointer having value zero):
        <pre>
    std::function&lt;int(int)&gt; ptr2int;

    if (not ptr2int)
        cout &lt;&lt; "ptr2int is not yet pointing to a function\n";
</pre>
<p>
Polymorphous function wrappers can also be used to refer to functions,
functors or other polymorphous function wrappers having prototypes for which
standard conversions exist for either parameters or return values. E.g.,
        <pre>
    bool predicate(long long value);

    void demo()
    {
        std::function&lt;int(int)&gt; ptr2int;

        ptr2int = predicate;    // OK, convertible param. and return type

        struct Local
        {
            short operator()(char ch);
        };

        Local object;

        std::function&lt;short(char)&gt; ptr2char(object);

        ptr2int = object;       // OK, object is a functor whose function
                                //  operator has a convertible param. and
                                // return type.
        ptr2int = ptr2char;     // OK, now using a polym. funct. wrapper
    }
</pre>
<p>
<a name="NAMERESFUN"></a><a name="l519"></a>
<h2 >21.13: Compiling template definitions and instantiations</h2>
    Consider this definition of the <code >add</code> function template:
        <pre>
    template &lt;typename Container, typename Type&gt;
    Type add(Container const &amp;container, Type init)
    {
        return std::accumulate(container.begin(), container.end(), init);
    }
</pre>
    Here <code >std::accumulate</code> is called using <code >container</code>'s <code >begin</code> and
<code >end</code> members.
<p>
The calls <code >container.begin()</code> and <code >container.end()</code> are said to
        <a name="an2832"></a>
    <em >depend on template type parameters</em>. The compiler, not having seen
<code >container</code>'s interface, cannot check whether <code >container</code> actually
has members <code >begin</code> and <code >end</code> returning input iterators.
<p>
On the other hand, <code >std::accumulate</code> itself is independent of any
template type parameter. Its <em >arguments</em> depend on template parameters, but
the function call itself isn't. Statements in a template's body that are
independent of template type parameters are said <em >not to depend on template
type parameters</em>.
<p>
When the compiler encounters a template definition, it verifies the
syntactic correctness of all statements not depending on template
parameters. I.e., it must have seen all class definitions, all type
definitions, all function declarations etc. that are used in those statements.
If the compiler hasn't seen the required definitions and declarations then it
will reject the template's definition. Therefore, when submitting the above
template to the compiler the header file <code >numeric</code> must first have been
included as this header file declares <code >std::accumulate</code>.
<p>
With statements depending on template parameters the compiler cannot
perform those extensive syntactic checks. It has no way to verify the
existence of a member <code >begin</code> for the as yet unspecified type
<code >Container</code>. In these cases the compiler performs superficial checks,
assuming that the required members, operators and types eventually become
available.
<p>
The location in the program's source where the template is instantiated is
        <a name="an2833"></a> <a name="an2834"></a> called
its <em >point of instantiation</em>. At the point of instantiation the compiler
deduces the actual types of the template's parameters. At that point it checks
the syntactic correctness of the template's statements that depend on template
type parameters. This implies that the compiler must have seen the required
declarations <em >only at the point of instantiation</em>.  As a
        <a name="an2835"></a>rule of thumb,
    you should make sure that all required declarations (usually: header
files) have been read by the compiler at every point of instantiation of the
template. For the template's definition itself a more relaxed requirement can
be formulated. When the definition is read only the declarations required for
statements <em >not</em> depending on the template's type parameters must have been
provided.
<p>
<a name="FUNCTIONSELECTION"></a><a name="l520"></a>
<h2 >21.14: The function selection mechanism</h2>
When the compiler encounters a function call, it must decide which function to
call when overloaded functions are available. Earlier we've encountered
principles like `the most specific function is selected'. This is a
fairly intuitive description of the compiler's <a name="an2836"></a>function selection mechanism.
In this section we'll have a closer look at this mechanism.
<p>
Assume we ask the compiler to compile the following <code >main</code> function:
        <pre>
    int main()
    {
        process(3, 3);
    }
</pre>
    Furthermore assume that the compiler has encountered the following
function declarations when it's about to compile <code >main</code>:
        <pre>
    template &lt;typename T&gt;
    void process(T &amp;t1, int i);                 // 1

    template &lt;typename T1, typename T2&gt;
    void process(T1 const &amp;t1, T2 const &amp;t2);   // 2

    template &lt;typename T&gt;
    void process(T const &amp;t, double d);         // 3

    template &lt;typename T&gt;
    void process(T const &amp;t, int i);            // 4

    template &lt;&gt;
    void process&lt;int, int&gt;(int i1, int i2);     // 5

    void process(int i1, int i2);               // 6

    void process(int i, double d);              // 7

    void process(double d, int i);              // 8

    void process(double d1, double d2);         // 9

    void process(std::string s, int i)          // 10

    int add(int, int);                          // 11
</pre>
    The compiler, having read <code >main</code>'s statement, must now decide which
function must actually be called. It proceeds as follows:
    <ul>
    <li> First, a set of
 <a name="an2837"></a> <a name="an2838"></a><em >candidate functions</em> is constructed. This set
contains all functions that:
        <ul>
        <li> are visible at the point of the call;
        <li> have the same names as the called function.
        </ul>
        As function 11 has a different name, it is removed from the set. The
compiler is left with a set of 10 candidate functions.
<p>
<li> Second, the set of
 <a name="an2839"></a> <a name="an2840"></a><em >viable functions</em> is constructed. Viable functions
are functions for which <a name="an2841"></a>type conversions exist that can be applied so as to
match the types of the function's parameters to the types of the actual
arguments.
<p>
This implies that at least the number of arguments must match the number of
parameters of the viable functions. Function 10's first argument is a
<code >string</code>. As a <code >string</code> cannot be initialized by an <code >int</code> value no
approprate conversion exists and function 10 is removed from the list of
candidate functions.  <code >double</code> parameters can be retained. Standard
conversions <em >do</em> exists for <code >int</code>s to <code >double</code>s, so all functions having
ordinary <code >double</code> parameters can be retained. Therefore, the set of viable
functions consists of functions 1 through 9.
    </ul>
    At this point the compiler tries to determine the types of the template
type parameters. This step is outlined in the following subsection.
<p>
<a name="l521"></a>
<h2 >21.15: Determining the template type parameters</h2>
    Having determined the set of candidate functions and from that set the set of
viable functions the compiler must now determine the actual types of the
template type parameters.
<p>
It may use any of the three standard template parameter transformation
procedures (cf. section <a href="cplusplus21.html#TEMPFUNARGS">21.4</a>) when trying to match actual types to
template type parameters. In this process it concludes that no type can be
determined for the <code >T</code> in function 1's <code >T &amp;t1</code> parameter as the argument
<code >3</code> is a constant <code >int</code> value. Thus function 1 is removed from the list of
viable functions. The compiler is now confronted with the following set of
potentially instantiated function templates and ordinary functions:
        <pre>
    void process(T1 [= int] const &amp;t1, T2 [= int] const &amp;t2);   // 2
    void process(T [= int] const &amp;t, double d);                 // 3
    void process(T [= int] const &amp;t, int i);                    // 4
    void process&lt;int, int&gt;(int i1, int i2);                     // 5
    void process(int i1, int i2);                               // 6
    void process(int i, double d);                              // 7
    void process(double d, int i);                              // 8
    void process(double d1, double d2);                         // 9
</pre>
<p>
The compiler associates a <em >direct match count</em> value to each of the
viable functions. The direct match count counts the number of arguments that
can be matched to function parameters without an (automatic) type
conversion. E.g., for function 2 this count equals 2, for function 7 it is 1
and for function 9 it is 0. The functions are now (decrementally) sorted by
their direct match count values:
        <pre>
                                                             match
                                                             count
    void process(T1 [= int] const &amp;t1, T2 [= int] const &amp;t2);  2 // 2
    void process(T [= int] const &amp;t, int i);                   2 // 4
    void process&lt;int, int&gt;(int i1, int i2);                    2 // 5
    void process(int i1, int i2);                              2 // 6
    void process(T [= int] const &amp;t, double d);                1 // 3
    void process(int i, double d);                             1 // 7
    void process(double d, int i);                             1 // 8
    void process(double d1, double d2);                        0 // 9
</pre>
    If there is no draw for the top value the corresponding function is
selected and the function selection process is completed.
<p>
When multiple functions appear at the top the compiler verifies that no
ambiguity has been encountered. An ambiguity is encountered if the
<em >sequences</em> of parameters for which type conversions were (not) required
differ. As an example consider functions 3 and 8. Using D for `direct match'
and C for `conversion' the arguments match function 3 as D,C and function 8 as
C,D. Assuming that 2, 4, 5 and 6 were not available, then the compiler would
have reported an ambiguity as the sequences of argument/parameter matching
procedures differ for functions 3 and 8. The same difference is encountered
comparing functions 7 and 8, but no such difference is encountered comparing
functions 3 and 7.
<p>
At this point there is a draw for the top value and the compiler
proceeds with the subset of associated functions (functions 2, 4, 5 and
6). With each of these functions an `ordinary parameter count' is associated
counting the number of non-template parameters of the functions. The functions
are decrementally sorted by this count, resulting in:
        <pre>
                                                         ordin. param.
                                                             count
    void process(int i1, int i2);                              2 // 6
    void process(T [= int] const &amp;t, int i);                   1 // 4
    void process(T1 [= int] const &amp;t1, T2 [= int] const &amp;t2);  0 // 2
    void process&lt;int, int&gt;(int i1, int i2);                    0 // 5
</pre>
    Now there is no draw for the top value. The corresponding function
(<code >process(int, int)</code>, function 6) is selected and the function selection
process is completed. Function 6 is used in <code >main</code>'s function call
statement.
<p>
Had function 6 not been defined, function 4 would have been used. Assuming
that neither function 4 nor function 6 had been defined, the selection
process would continue with functions 2 and 5:
        <pre>
                                                         ordin. param.
                                                             count
    void process(T1 [= int] const &amp;t1, T2 [= int] const &amp;t2);  0 // 2
    void process&lt;int, int&gt;(int i1, int i2);                    0 // 5
</pre>
<p>
In this situation a draw is encountered once again and the selection
process continues. A `type of function' value is associated with each of the
functions having the highest ordinary parameter count and these functions are
decrementally sorted by their type of function values. Value 2 is associated
to ordinary functions, value 1 to template explicit specializations and value
0 to plain function templates.
<p>
If there is no draw for the top value the corresponding function is
selected and the function selection process is completed. If there is a draw
the compiler reports an ambiguity and cannot determine which function to
call.  Assuming only functions 2 and 5 existed then this selection step
would have resulted in the following ordering:
        <pre>
                                                           function
                                                             type
    void process&lt;int, int&gt;(int i1, int i2);                    1 // 5
    void process(T1 [= int] const &amp;t1, T2 [= int] const &amp;t2);  0 // 2
</pre>
    Function 5, the template explicit specialization, would have been
selected.

 Here is a summary of the function template selection mechanism (cf. figure
Figure <a href="cplusplus21.html#selection">25</a>):
    <ul>
    <li> The set of candidate functions is constructed: identical names;
    <li> The set of viable functions is constructed: correct number of

    <li> Template type determination, dropping templates whose type parameters

    <li> Decrementally sort the functions by their direct match count
        values. If there is no draw for the top value the associated function
        is selected, completing the selection process.
    <li> Inspect the functions associated with the top value for ambiguities
        in automatic type conversion sequences. If different sequences are
        encountered report an ambiguity and terminate the selection process.
    <li> Decrementally sort the functions associated with the top value by
        their ordinary parameter count values.  If there is no draw for the
        top value the associated function is selected, completing the
        selection process.
    <li> Decrementally sort the functions associated with the top value by
        their function type values using 2 for ordinary functions, 1 for
        template explicit specializations and 0 for plain function templates.
        If there is no draw for the top value the associated function is
        selected, completing the selection process.
    <li> Report an ambiguity and terminate the selection process.

<h2 >21.16: SFINAE: Substitution Failure Is Not An Error</h2>
Consider the following struct definition:
        <pre>
    struct Int
    {
        typedef int type;
    };
</pre>
    Although at this point it may seem strange to embed a typedef in a struct,
in chapter <a href="cplusplus23.html#ADVANCEDTEMPL">23</a> we'll encounter situations where this is
actually very useful.  It allows us to define a variable of a type that is
required by the template. E.g., (ignore the use of <code >typename</code> in the
following function parameter list, but see section <a href="cplusplus22.html#DISTINGUISH">22.2.1</a> for
details):
        <pre>
    template &lt;typename Type&gt;
    void func(typename Type::type value)
    {
    }
</pre>
    To call <code >func(10)</code> <code >Int</code> has to be specified explicitly since there
may be many structs that define <code >type</code>: the compiler needs some
assistance. The correct call is <code >func&lt;Int&gt;(10)</code>. Now that it's clear that
<code >Int</code> is meant, and the compiler correctly deduces that <code >value</code> is an
<code >int</code>.
<p>
But templates may be overloaded and our next definition is:
        <pre>
    template &lt;typename Type&gt;
    void func(Type value)
    {}
</pre>
    Now, to make sure this function is used we specify <code >func&lt;int&gt;(10)</code> and
again this compiles flawlessly.
<p>
But as we've seen in the previous section when the compiler determines
which template to instantiate it creates a list of viable functions by
matching the parameter types of available function prototypes with the
provided actual argument types. To do so it has to <em >determine</em> the types of
the parameters and herein lies a problem.
<p>
When evaluating <code >Type = int</code> the compiler encounters the prototypes
<code >func(int::type)</code> (first template definition) and <code >func(int)</code> (second
template definition). But there is no <code >int::type</code>, and so in a way this
generates an error. However, the error results from substituting the provided
template type argument into the various template definitions.
<p>
A type-problem caused by substituting a type in a template definition is
<em >not</em> considered an error, but merely an indication that that particular
type cannot be used in that particular template. The template is therefore
removed from the list of candidate functions.
<p>
This principle is known as <a name="an2842"></a><em >substitution failure</em> <em >is not an error</em>
<a name="an2843"></a>(SFINAE) and it is often used by the compiler to select not only a
simple overloaded function (as shown here) but also to choose among available
template specializations (see also chapters <a href="cplusplus22.html#TEMPCLASS">22</a> and
<a href="cplusplus23.html#ADVANCEDTEMPL">23</a>).
<p>
<a name="l523"></a>
<h2 >21.17: Summary of the template declaration syntax</h2>
In this section the basic syntactic constructions for declaring templates
are summarized. When <em >defining</em> templates, the terminating
semicolon should be replaced by a function body.
<p>
Not every template declaration may be converted into a template definition. If
a definition may be provided it is explicitly mentioned.

</pre>
    </ul>
<p>
<a name="l524"></a>
<h2 >21.18: variable templates</h2>
In addition to function templates and class templates (cf. chapter
<a href="cplusplus22.html#TEMPCLASS">22</a>) <strong >C++</strong> supports <em >variable templates</em>. Variable templates
might come in handy when defining (function or class) templates defining
variables of types specified by template type parameters.
<p>
A variable template starts with a familiar <code >template</code> header, followed by
the definition of the variable itself. The template header specifies a type,
for which a default type may also be specified. E.g.,
        <pre>
    template&lt;typename T = long double&gt;
    constexpr T pi = T(3.1415926535897932385);
</pre>
<p>
To use this variable a type must be specified, and as long as the initialized
value can be converted to the specified type the conversion is silently 
performed by the compiler:
        <pre>
    cout &lt;&lt; pi&lt;&gt; &lt;&lt; ' ' &lt;&lt; pi&lt;int&gt;;
</pre>
    At the second insertion the <code >long double</code> initialization value is
converted to <code >int</code>, and 3 is displayed.
<p>
Specializations are also supported. E.g., to show the text `pi' a
specialization for a <code >char const *</code> type can be defined:
        <pre>
    template&lt;&gt;
    constexpr char const *pi&lt;char const *&gt; = "pi";
</pre>
With this specialization we can do <code >cout &lt;&lt; pi&lt;char const *&gt;</code> to show
<code >pi</code>.
