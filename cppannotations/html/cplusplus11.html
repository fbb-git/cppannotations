<h1 >Chapter 11: More Operator Overloading</h1>
Having covered the overloaded assignment operator in chapter <a href="cplusplus09.html#MEMORY">9</a>, and
having shown several examples of other overloaded operators as well (i.e., the
insertion and extraction operators in chapters <a href="cplusplus03.html#FirstImpression">3</a> and
<a href="cplusplus06.html#IOStreams">6</a>), we now take a look at <a name="an1077"></a>operator overloading in general.
<p>
<a name="OPERATORINDEX"></a><a name="l205"></a>
<h2 >11.1: Overloading `operator[]()'</h2>
As our next example of operator overloading, we introduce a class <code >IntArray</code>
encapsulating an array of <code >int</code>s. Indexing the array elements is possible
using the standard array index operator <code >[]</code>, but additionally checks for
 <a name="an1078"></a>array bounds overflow are performed. Furthermore, the
 <a name="an1079"></a>index operator (<a name="an1080"></a><code >operator[]</code>) is interesting in that it can be used  in
expressions as both <a name="an1081"></a>lvalue and as <a name="an1082"></a>rvalue.
<p>
Here is an example showing the basic use of the class:
        <pre>
    int main()
    {
        IntArray x{ 20 };               // 20 ints

        for (int i = 0; i &lt; 20; i++)
            x[i] = i * 2;               // assign the elements

        for (int i = 0; i &lt;= 20; i++)   // produces boundary overflow
            cout &lt;&lt; "At index " &lt;&lt; i &lt;&lt; ": value is " &lt;&lt; x[i] &lt;&lt; '\n';
    }
</pre>
<p>
First, the constructor is used to create an object containing 20
<code >int</code>s. The elements stored in the object can be assigned or retrieved. The
first <code >for</code>-loop assigns values to the elements using the index operator,
the second <code >for</code>-loop retrieves the values but also results in a
run-time error once the non-existing value <code >x[20]</code> is addressed. The
<code >IntArray</code> class interface is:
        <pre>
    #include &lt;cstddef&gt;

    class IntArray
    {
        int     *d_data;
        size_t d_size;

         public:
            IntArray(size_t size = 1);
            IntArray(IntArray const &amp;other);
            ~IntArray();
            IntArray &amp;operator=(IntArray const &amp;other);

                                                // overloaded index operators:
            int &amp;operator[](size_t index);              // first
            int operator[](size_t index) const;         // second

            void swap(IntArray &amp;other);         // trivial

        private:
            void boundary(size_t index) const;
            int &amp;operatorIndex(size_t index) const;
    };
</pre>
    This class has the following characteristics:
    <ul>
    <li> One of its constructors has a <code >size_t</code> parameter having a
default argument value, specifying the number of <code >int</code> elements in the
object.
    <li> The class internally uses a pointer to reach allocated memory.
Hence, the necessary tools are provided: a copy constructor, an overloaded
assignment operator and a destructor.
    <li> Note that there are two overloaded index operators. Why are there
two?
<p>
The first overloaded index operator allows us to reach and modify the
elements of non-constant <code >IntArray</code> objects.  This overloaded operator's
prototype is a function returning <em >a reference</em> to an <code >int</code>. This allows
us to use expressions like <code >x[10]</code> as rvalues <em >or</em> lvalues.
<p>
With non-const <code >IntArray</code> objects <code >operator[]</code> can therefore be used
to retrieve and to assign values.  The return value of the non-const
<code >operator[]</code> member is <em >not</em> an <code >int const &amp;</code>, but an <code >int &amp;</code>. In this
situation we don't use <code >const</code>, as we must be able to modify the element we
want to access when the operator is used as lvalue.
<p>
This whole scheme fails if there's nothing to assign. Consider the
situation where we have an <code >IntArray const stable(5)</code>. Such an object is an
immutable <em >const</em> object. The compiler detects this and refuses to compile
this object definition if only the non-const <code >operator[]</code> is
available. Hence the second overloaded index operator is added to the class's
interface. Here the return value is an <code >int</code>, rather than an <code >int &amp;</code>, and
the member function itself is a <code >const</code> member function. This second form of
the overloaded index operator is automatically used by the compiler with
<code >const</code> objects. It is used for value <em >retrieval</em> instead of value
assignment. That, of course, is precisely what we want when using <code >const</code>
objects. In this situation members are overloaded only by their <code >const</code>
attribute. This form of function overloading was introduced earlier in the
<strong >C++</strong> Annotations (sections <a href="cplusplus02.html#FunctionOverloading">2.5.4</a> and
<a href="cplusplus07.html#ConstFunctions">7.7</a>). 
<p>
Note the difference between the return types of the two overloaded index
operators: <code >int &amp;</code> and <code >int</code>. Here, using a value return type for the
const-index operator is OK, because the return type is a simple built-in type:
returning a copy of the requested value is likely more efficient than
returning a const reference, which must be dereferenced whenever it is
used. However, for more complex return types (generally: objects) value return
types should be avoided and the const index operator should define a <code >Type
const &amp;</code> return type instead of a <code >Type</code> value return type.
<p>
Since <code >IntArray</code> stores values of a primitive type <code >IntArray</code>'s
<code >operator[] const</code> could also have defined a value return type.  However,
with objects one usually doesn't want the extra copying that's implied with
value return types. In those cases <code >const &amp;</code> return values are preferred for
<code >const</code> member functions. So, in the <code >IntArray</code> class an <code >int</code> return
value could have been used as well, resulting in the following prototype:
        <pre>
    int IntArray::operator[](size_t index) const;
</pre>
    <li> As there is only one pointer data member, the destruction of the
memory allocated by the object is a simple <code >delete[] data</code>.
    </ul>
    Now, the implementation of the members (omitting the trivial
implementation of <code >swap</code>, cf. chapter <a href="cplusplus09.html#MEMORY">9</a>) are:
        <pre>
    #include "intarray.ih"

    IntArray::IntArray(size_t size)
    :
        d_size(size)
    {
        if (d_size &lt; 1)
            throw string("IntArray: size of array must be &gt;= 1");

        d_data = new int[d_size];
    }

    IntArray::IntArray(IntArray const &amp;other)
    :
        d_size(other.d_size),
        d_data(new int[d_size])
    {
        memcpy(d_data, other.d_data, d_size * sizeof(int));
    }

    IntArray::~IntArray()
    {
        delete[] d_data;
    }

    IntArray &amp;IntArray::operator=(IntArray const &amp;other)
    {
        IntArray tmp(other);
        swap(tmp);
        return *this;
    }

    int &amp;IntArray::operatorIndex(size_t index) const
    {
        boundary(index);
        return d_data[index];
    }

    int &amp;IntArray::operator[](size_t index)
    {
        return operatorIndex(index);
    }

    int IntArray::operator[](size_t index) const
    {
        return operatorIndex(index);
    }

    void IntArray::boundary(size_t index) const
    {
        if (index &lt; d_size)
            return;
        ostringstream out;
        out  &lt;&lt; "IntArray: boundary overflow, index = " &lt;&lt;
                index &lt;&lt; ", should be &lt; " &lt;&lt; d_size &lt;&lt; '\n';
        throw out.str();
    }
</pre>
    Note how the <code >operator[]</code> members were implemented: as non-const members
may call const member functions and as the implementation of the <code >const</code>
member function is identical to the non-const member function's implementation
both <code >operator[]</code> members could be defined inline using an auxiliary
function <code >int &amp;operatorIndex(size_t index) const</code>.  A <code >const</code> member
function may return a non-const reference (or pointer) return value, referring
to one of the data members of its object. Of course, this is a potentially
dangerous backdoor that may break data hiding. However, the members in the
public interface prevent this breach and so the two public <code >operator[]</code>
members may themselves safely call the same <code >int &amp;operatorIndex() const</code>
member, that defines a
 <a name="an1083"></a><em >private backdoor</em>.
<p>
<a name="EXTRACTORS"></a><a name="l206"></a>
<h2 >11.2: Overloading the insertion and extraction operators</h2>
    Classes may be adapted in such a way that their objects may be inserted
into and extracted from, respectively, a <code >std::ostream</code> and
<code >std::istream</code>.
<p>
The class <code >std::ostream</code> defines insertion operators for primitive
types, such as <code >int</code>, <code >char *</code>, etc.. In this section we learn how to
extend the existing functionality of classes (in particular <code >std::istream</code>
and <code >std::ostream</code>) in such a way that they can be used also in combination
with classes developed much later in history.
<p>
In particular we will show how the
 <a name="an1084"></a>insertion operator can be overloaded allowing the insertion of any type of
object, say <code >Person</code> (see chapter <a href="cplusplus09.html#MEMORY">9</a>), into an <code >ostream</code>. Having
defined such an overloaded operator we're able to use the following code:
        <pre>
    Person kr("Kernighan and Ritchie", "unknown", "unknown");

    cout &lt;&lt; "Name, address and phone number of Person kr:\n" &lt;&lt; kr &lt;&lt; '\n';
</pre>
    The statement <code >cout</code> &lt;&lt; <code >kr</code> uses <code >operator</code>&lt;&lt;.  This member
function has two operands: an <code >ostream &amp;</code> and a <code >Person &amp;</code>. The required
action is defined in an overloaded <a name="an1085"></a><em >free function</em> <code >operator</code>&lt;&lt; expecting two
arguments:
        <pre>
                                // declared in `person.h'
    std::ostream &amp;operator&lt;&lt;(std::ostream &amp;out, Person const &amp;person);

                                // defined in some source file
    ostream &amp;operator&lt;&lt;(ostream &amp;out, Person const &amp;person)
    {
        return
            out &lt;&lt;
                "Name:    " &lt;&lt; person.name() &lt;&lt; ", "
                "Address: " &lt;&lt; person.address() &lt;&lt; ", "
                "Phone:   " &lt;&lt; person.phone();
    }
</pre>
    The free function <code >operator</code>&lt;&lt; has the following noteworthy characteristics:
    <ul>
    <li> The function returns a reference to an <code >ostream</code> object,
to enable `chaining' of the insertion operator.
    <li> The two operands of <code >operator</code>&lt;&lt; are passed to the free function as its
arguments. In the example, the parameter <code >out</code> was initialized by <code >cout</code>,
the parameter <code >person</code> by <code >kr</code>.
    </ul>
<p>
In order to overload the <em >extraction</em> operator for, e.g., the <code >Person</code>
class, members are needed modifying the class's private data members. Such
 <a name="an1086"></a><em >modifiers</em> are normally offered by the class interface. For
the <code >Person</code> class these members could be the following:
        <pre>
    void setName(char const *name);
    void setAddress(char const *address);
    void setPhone(char const *phone);
</pre>
    These members may easily be implemented: the memory
pointed to by the corresponding data member must be deleted, and the data
member should point to a copy of the text pointed to by the parameter. E.g.,
        <pre>
    void Person::setAddress(char const *address)
    {
        delete[] d_address;
        d_address = strdupnew(address);
    }
</pre>
    A more elaborate function should check the reasonableness of the new
address (<code >address</code> also shouldn't be a 0-pointer). This
however, is not further pursued here. Instead, let's have a look at the final
 <a name="an1087"></a><a name="an1088"></a><code >operator</code>&gt;&gt;. A simple implementation is:
        <pre>
    istream &amp;operator&gt;&gt;(istream &amp;in, Person &amp;person)
    {
        string name;
        string address;
        string phone;

        if (in &gt;&gt; name &gt;&gt; address &gt;&gt; phone)    // extract three strings
        {
            person.setName(name.c_str());
            person.setAddress(address.c_str());
            person.setPhone(phone.c_str());
        }
        return in;
    }
</pre>
    Note the stepwise approach that is followed here. First, the required
information is extracted using available extraction operators. Then, if that
succeeds, <em >modifiers</em> are used to modify the data members of the object to
be extracted. Finally, the stream object itself is returned as a reference.
<p>
<a name="ConversionOperators"></a><a name="l207"></a>
<h2 >11.3: Conversion operators</h2>
    A class may be constructed around a built-in type. E.g., a class
<code >String</code>, constructed around the <a name="an1089"></a><code >char *</code> type. Such a class may define
all kinds of operations, like assignments. Take a look at the following class
interface, designed after the <code >string</code> class:
        <pre>
    class String
    {
        char *d_string;

        public:
            String();
            String(char const *arg);
            ~String();
            String(String const &amp;other);
            String &amp;operator=(String const &amp;rvalue);
            String &amp;operator=(char const *rvalue);
    };
</pre>
    Objects of this class can be initialized from a <code >char const *</code>, and also
from a <code >String</code> itself. There is an overloaded assignment operator, allowing
the assignment from a <code >String</code> object and from a <code >char const
*</code>&nbsp;(Note that the assignment from a <code >char const *</code> also allows the
null-pointer. An assignment like <code >stringObject = 0</code> is perfectly in order.).
<p>
Usually, in classes that are less directly linked to their data than this
<code >String</code> class, there will be an <a name="an1090"></a><em >accessor member function</em>,
like a member <code >char const *String::c_str() const</code>. However, the need to use
this latter member doesn't appeal to our intuition when an array of <code >String</code>
objects is defined by, e.g., a class <code >StringArray</code>. If this latter class
provides the <a name="an1091"></a><code >operator[]</code> to access individual <code >String</code> members, it would
most likely offer at least the following class interface:
        <pre>
    class StringArray
    {
        String *d_store;
        size_t d_n;

        public:
            StringArray(size_t size);
            StringArray(StringArray const &amp;other);
            StringArray &amp;operator=(StringArray const &amp;rvalue);
            ~StringArray();

            String &amp;operator[](size_t index);
    };
</pre>
    This interface allows us to assign <code >String</code> elements to each other:
        <pre>
    StringArray sa{ 10 };

    sa[4] = sa[3];  // String to String assignment
</pre>
    But it is also possible to assign a <code >char const *</code> to an element of
<code >sa</code>:
        <pre>
    sa[3] = "hello world";
</pre>
    Here, the following steps are taken:
    <ul>
    <li> First, <code >sa[3]</code> is evaluated. This results in a <code >String</code> reference.
    <li> Next, the <code >String</code> class is inspected for an overloaded assignment,
        expecting a <code >char const *</code> to its right-hand side. This operator is
        found, and the string object <code >sa[3]</code> receives its new value.
    </ul>
    Now we try to do it the other way around: how to <em >access</em> the
<code >char const *</code> that's stored in <code >sa[3]</code>? The following attempt fails:
        <pre>
    char const *cp = sa[3];
</pre>
    It fails since we would need an overloaded assignment operator for the
'class' <code >char const *</code>. Unfortunately, there isn't such a class, and
therefore we can't build that overloaded assignment operator (see also section
<a href="cplusplus11.html#OverloadableOperators">11.13</a>). Furthermore, <em >casting</em> won't work as the
compiler doesn't know how to cast a <code >String</code> to a <code >char const *</code>.  How
to proceed?
<p>
One possibility is to define an accessor member function <code >c_str()</code>:
        <pre>
    char const *cp = sa[3].c_str()
</pre>
    This compiles fine but looks clumsy.... A far better approach would be to
use a <a name="an1092"></a><em >conversion operator</em>.
<p>
A <em >conversion operator</em> is a kind of overloaded operator, but this time
the overloading is used to cast the object to another type.
In class interfaces, the general form of a
conversion operator is:
        <pre>
    operator &lt;type&gt;() const;
</pre>
    Conversion operators usually are <code >const</code> member functions: they are
automatically called when their objects are used as <em >rvalues</em> in expressions
having a <code >type</code> <em >lvalue</em>.  Using a conversion operator a <code >String</code>
object may be interpreted as a <code >char const *</code> rvalue, allowing us to perform
the above assignment.
<p>
Conversion operators are somewhat dangerous. The conversion is automatically
performed by the compiler and unless its use is perfectly transparent it may
confuse those who read code in which conversion operators are used. E.g.,
novice <strong >C++</strong> programmers are frequently confused by statements like `<code >if
(cin) ...</code>'.
<p>
As a <a name="an1093"></a>rule of thumb: classes should define at most one conversion
operator. Multiple conversion operators may be defined but frequently result
in ambiguous code. E.g., if a class defines <code >operator bool() const</code> and
<code >operator int() const</code> then passing an object of this class to a function
expecting a <code >size_t</code> argument results in an ambiguity as an <code >int</code> and a
<code >bool</code> may both be used to initialize a <code >size_t</code>.
<p>
In the current example, the class <code >String</code> could define the following
conversion operator for <code >char const *</code>:
        <pre>
    String::operator char const *() const
    {
        return d_string;
    }
</pre>
    Notes:
    <ul>
    <li> Conversion operators do not define return types. The conversion
operator returns a value of the type specified beyond the <code >operator</code>
keyword.
    <li> In certain situations (e.g., when a <code >String</code> argument is passed to
a function specifying an <a name="an1094"></a>ellipsis parameter) the compiler needs a hand to
disambiguate our intentions. A <code >static_cast</code> solves the problem.
    <li> With <em >template functions</em> conversion operators may not work
immediately as expected. For example, when defining a conversion operator
<code >X::operator std::string const() const</code> then <code >cout &lt;&lt; X()</code> won't
compile. The reason for this is explained in section <a href="cplusplus21.html#SPECIALIZING">21.9</a>, but a
shortcut allowing the conversion operator to work is to define the following
overloaded <code >operator&lt;&lt;</code> function:
    <pre>
std::ostream &amp;operator&lt;&lt;(std::ostream &amp;out, std::string const &amp;str)
{
    return out.write(str.data(), str.length());
}
</pre>
    </ul>
    Conversion operators are also used when objects of classes defining
conversion operators are inserted into streams. Realize that the right hand
sides of insertion operators are function parameters that are initialized by
the operator's right hand side arguments. The rules are simple:
    <ul>
    <li> If a class <code >X</code> defining a conversion operator also defines an
insertion operator accepting an <code >X</code> object the insertion operator is used;
    <li> Otherwise, if the type returned by the conversion operator is
insertable then the conversion operator is used;
    <li> Otherwise, a compilation error results. Note that this happens if the
type returned by the conversion operator itself defines a conversion operator
to a type that may be inserted into a stream.
    </ul>
    In the following example an object of class <code >Insertable</code> is directly
inserted; an object of the class <code >Convertor</code> uses the conversion operator;
an object of the class <code >Error</code> cannot be inserted since it does not define
an insertion operator and the type returned by its conversion operator cannot
be inserted either (<code >Text</code> <em >does</em> define an <code >operator int() const</code>, but
the fact that a <code >Text</code> itself cannot be inserted causes the error):
        <pre>
    #include &lt;iostream&gt;
    #include &lt;string&gt;
    using namespace std;

    struct Insertable
    {
        operator int() const
        {
            cout &lt;&lt; "op int()\n";
            return 0;
        }
    };
    ostream &amp;operator&lt;&lt;(ostream &amp;out, Insertable const &amp;ins)
    {
        return out &lt;&lt; "insertion operator";
    }
    struct Convertor
    {
        operator Insertable() const
        {
            return Insertable();
        }
    };
    struct Text
    {
        operator int() const
        {
            return 1;
        }
    };
    struct Error
    {
        operator Text() const
        {
            return Text{};
        }
    };

    int main()
    {
        Insertable insertable;
        cout &lt;&lt; insertable &lt;&lt; '\n';
        Convertor convertor;
        cout &lt;&lt; convertor &lt;&lt; '\n';
        Error error;
        cout &lt;&lt; error &lt;&lt; '\n';
    }
</pre>
<p>
Some final remarks regarding conversion operators:
    <ul>
    <li> A conversion operator should be a `natural extension' of the
facilities of the object. For example, the stream classes define <code >operator
bool()</code>, allowing constructions like <code >if (cin)</code>.
    <li> A conversion operator should return an <em >rvalue</em>. It should do so to
enforce data-hiding and because it is the intended use of the conversion
operator. Defining a conversion operator as an <em >lvalue</em> (e.g., defining an
<code >operator int &amp;()</code> conversion operator) opens up a back door, and the
operator can only be used as <em >lvalue</em> when explicitly called (as in:
<code >x.operator int&amp;() = 5</code>). Don't use it.
    <li> Conversion operators should be defined as <code >const</code> member functions
as they don't modify their object's data members.
    <li> Conversion operators returning composed objects should return const
references to these objects whenever possible to avoid calling the composed
object's copy constructor.
    </ul>
<p>
<a name="EXPLICIT"></a><a name="l208"></a>
<h2 >11.4: The keyword `explicit'</h2>
    Conversions are not only performed by conversion operators, but also by
constructors accepting one argument (i.e., constructors having one or multiple
parameters, specifying default argument values for all parameters or for all
but the first parameter).
<p>
Assume a data base class <code >DataBase</code> is defined in which <code >Person</code>
objects can be stored. It defines a <code >Person *d_data</code> pointer, and so it
offers a copy constructor and an overloaded assignment operator.
<p>
In addition to the copy constructor <code >DataBase</code> offers a default
constructor and several additional constructors:
    <ul>
    <li><code >DataBase(Person const &amp;)</code>: the <code >DataBase</code> initially contains a
single <code >Person</code> object;
    <li><code >DataBase(istream &amp;in)</code>: the data about multiple persons are read from
<code >in</code>.
    <li><code >DataBase(size_t count, istream &amp;in = cin)</code>: the data of <code >count</code>
persons are read from <code >in</code>, by default the standard input stream.
    </ul>
<p>
The above constructors all are perfectly reasonable. But they also allow
the compiler to compile the following code without producing any warning at
all:
        <pre>
    DataBase db;
    DataBase db2;
    Person person;

    db2 = db;           // 1
    db2 = person;       // 2
    db2 = 10;           // 3
    db2 = cin;          // 4
</pre>
    Statement 1 is perfectly reasonable: <code >db</code> is used to redefine
<code >db2</code>. Statement 2 might be understandable since we designed <code >DataBase</code> to
contain <code >Person</code> objects. Nevertheless, we might question the logic that's
used here as a <code >Person</code> is not some kind of <code >DataBase</code>. The logic becomes
even more opaque when looking at statements 3 and 4. Statement 3 in effect
waits for the data of 10 persons to appear at the standard input
stream. Nothing like that is suggested by <code >db2 = 10</code>.
<p>
Implicit <a name="an1095"></a>promotions are used with statements 2 through 4. Since
constructors accepting, respectively a <code >Person</code>, an <code >istream</code>, and a
<code >size_t</code> and an <code >istream</code> have been defined for <code >DataBase</code> and since the
assignment operator expects a <code >DataBase</code> right-hand side (rhs) argument the
compiler first converts the rhs arguments to anonymous <code >DataBase</code> objects
which are then assigned to <code >db2</code>.
<p>
It is good practice to prevent implicit promotions by using the
 <a name="an1096"></a><code >explicit</code> modifier when declaring a constructor. Constructors using the
<code >explicit</code> modifier can only be used to construct objects
explicitly. Statements 2-4 would not have compiled if the constructors
expecting one argument would have been declared using <code >explicit</code>. E.g.,
        <pre>
    explicit DataBase(Person const &amp;person);
    explicit DataBase(size_t count, std:istream &amp;in);
</pre>
<p>
Having declared all constructors accepting one argument as <code >explicit</code>
the above assignments would have required the explicit specification of
the appropriate constructors, thus clarifying the programmer's intent:
        <pre>
    DataBase db;
    DataBase db2;
    Person person;

    db2 = db;                   // 1
    db2 = DataBase{ person };   // 2
    db2 = DataBase{ 10 };       // 3
    db2 = DataBase{ cin };      // 4
</pre>
    As a <a name="an1097"></a>rule of thumb prefix one argument constructors with the
<code >explicit</code> keyword unless implicit promotions are perfectly natural
(<code >string</code>'s <code >char const *</code> accepting constructor is a case in point).
<p>
<a name="l209"></a>
<h3 >11.4.1: Explicit conversion operators</h3>
    In addition to explicit constructors, <strong >C++</strong> supports
 <a name="an1098"></a><a name="an1099"></a>
<em >explicit conversion operators</em>.
<p>
For example, a class might define <code >operator bool() const</code> returning <code >true</code>
if an object of that class is in a usable state and <code >false</code> if not.
Since the type <code >bool</code> is an arithmetic type this could result in unexpected
or unintended behavior. Consider:
        <pre>
    void process(bool value);

    class StreamHandler
    {
        public:
            operator bool() const;      // true: object is fit for use
            ...
    };

    int fun(StreamHandler &amp;sh)
    {
        int sx;

        if (sh)                         // intended use of operator bool()
            ... use sh as usual; also use `sx'

        process(sh);                    // typo: `sx' was intended
    }
</pre>
    In this example <code >process</code> unintentionally receives the value returned by
<code >operator bool</code> using the implicit conversion from <code >bool</code> to <code >int</code>.
<p>
When defining <code >explicit</code> conversion operators implicit conversions like the
one shown in the example are prevented. Such conversion operators can only be
used in situations where the converted type is explicitly required (as in the
condition clauses of <code >if</code> or <code >while</code> statements), or is explicitly
requested using a <code >static_cast</code>. To declare an explicit bool conversion
operator in class <code >StreamHandler</code>'s interface replace the above declaration
by:
    <pre>
        explicit operator bool() const;
</pre>
<p>
Since the C++14 standard <code >istreams</code> define an 
    <code >explicit operator bool() const</code>. As a consequence:
    <pre>
    while (cin.get(ch)) // compiles OK
        ;

    bool fun1()
    {
        return cin;     // 'bool = istream' won't compile as 
    }                   // istream defines 'explicit operator bool'

    bool fun1()
    {
        return static_cast&lt;bool&gt;(cin); // compiles OK
    }
</pre>

<a name="OVERLOADINCR"></a><a name="l210"></a>
<h2 >11.5: Overloading the increment and decrement operators</h2>
Overloading the 
    <a name="an1100"></a>increment operator <a name="an1101"></a>(<code >operator++</code>) and
    <a name="an1102"></a>decrement operator (<a name="an1103"></a> <code >operator--</code>) introduces a
small problem: there are two versions of each operator, as they may be used as
<em >postfix operator</em> (e.g., <code >x++</code>) or as <em >prefix operator</em> (e.g.,
<code >++x</code>).
<p>
Used as <em >postfix</em> operator, the value's object is returned as an
<a name="an1104"></a><em >rvalue</em>, temporary const object and the post-incremented variable itself
disappears from view. Used as <em >prefix</em> operator, the variable is
incremented, and its value is returned as <a name="an1105"></a><em >lvalue</em> and it may be altered
again by modifying the prefix operator's return value. Whereas these
characteristics are not <em >required</em> when the operator is overloaded, it is
strongly advised to implement these characteristics in any overloaded
increment or decrement operator.
<p>
Suppose we define a <a name="an1106"></a><em >wrapper class</em> around the <code >size_t</code> value
type. Such a class could offer the following (partially shown) interface:
        <pre>
    class Unsigned
    {
        size_t d_value;

        public:
            Unsigned();
            explicit Unsigned(size_t init);

            Unsigned &amp;operator++();
    }
</pre>
    The class's last member declares the <em >prefix</em> overloaded increment
operator. The returned <em >lvalue</em> is <code >Unsigned &amp;</code>. The member is easily
implemented:
        <pre>
    Unsigned &amp;Unsigned::operator++()
    {
        ++d_value;
        return *this;
    }
</pre>
<p>
To define the <em >postfix</em> operator, an overloaded version of the operator
is defined, expecting a (dummy) <code >int</code> argument. This might be considered a
<a name="an1107"></a><em >kludge</em>, or an acceptable application of function overloading. Whatever
your opinion in this matter, the following can be concluded:
    <ul>
    <li> Overloaded increment and decrement operators <em >without parameters</em>
are <em >prefix</em> operators, and should return <em >references</em> to the current
object.
    <li> Overloaded increment and decrement operators <em >having an int
parameter</em> are <em >postfix</em> operators, and should return a value which
is a copy of the object at the point where its postfix operator is used.
    </ul>
    The postfix increment operator is declared as follows in the class
<code >Unsigned</code>'s interface:
        <pre>
    Unsigned operator++(int);
</pre>
    It may be implemented as follows:
        <pre>
    Unsigned Unsigned::operator++(int)
    {
        Unsigned tmp{ *this };
        ++d_value;
        return tmp;
    }
</pre>
    Note that the operator's parameter is not used. It is only part of the
implementation to <em >disambiguate</em> the prefix- and postfix operators in
implementations and declarations.
<p>
In the above example the statement incrementing the current object offers
the <em >nothrow</em> guarantee as it only involves an operation on a
primitive type. If the initial copy construction throws then the original
object is not modified, if the return statement throws the object has safely
been modified. But incrementing an object could itself throw exceptions. How
to implement the increment operators in that case? Once again, <code >swap</code> is our
friend. Here are the pre- and postfix operators offering the strong guarantee
when the member <code >increment</code> performing the increment operation may throw:
        <pre>
    Unsigned &amp;Unsigned::operator++()
    {
        Unsigned tmp{ *this };
        tmp.increment();
        swap(tmp);
        return *this;
    }
    Unsigned Unsigned::operator++(int)
    {
        Unsigned tmp{ *this };
        tmp.increment();
        swap(tmp);
        return tmp;
    }
</pre>
    Both operators first create copies of the current objects. These copies
are incremented and then swapped with the current objects. If <code >increment</code>
throws the current objects remain unaltered; the swap operations ensure that
the correct objects are returned (the incremented object for the prefix
operator, the original object for the postfix operator) and that the current
objects become the incremented objects.
<p>
When calling the increment or decrement operator using its full member
function name then any <code >int</code> argument passed to the function results in
calling the postfix operator. Omitting the argument results in calling the
prefix operator. Example:
        <pre>
    Unsigned uns{ 13 };

    uns.operator++();     // prefix-incrementing uns
    uns.operator++(0);    // postfix-incrementing uns
</pre>
<p>
Both the prefix and postfix increment and decrement operators are deprecated
when applied to <code >bool</code> type of variables. In situations where a postfix
increment operator could be useful the <code >std::exchange</code> (cf. section
<a href="cplusplus19.html#EXCHANGE">19.1.11</a>) should be used.
<p>
<a name="OVERLOADBINARY"></a><a name="l211"></a>
<h2 >11.6: Overloading binary operators</h2>
    In various classes overloading binary operators (like <a name="an1108"></a><code >operator+</code>) can
be a very natural extension of the class's functionality. For example, the
<code >std::string</code> class has various overloaded <code >operator+</code> members.
<p>
Most binary operators come in two flavors: the plain binary operator (like
the <code >+</code> operator) and the compound binary assignment operator (like
<code >operator+=</code>). Whereas the plain binary operators return values, the
compound binary assignment operators return references to the objects for
which the operators were called. For example, with <code >std::string</code> objects the
following code (annotations below the example) may be used:
        <pre>
    std::string s1;
    std::string s2;
    std::string s3;

    s1 = s2 += s3;                  // 1
    (s2 += s3) + " postfix";        // 2
    s1 = "prefix " + s3;            // 3
    "prefix " + s3 + "postfix";     // 4
</pre>
    <ul>
    <li> at <code >// 1</code> the contents of <code >s3</code> is added to <code >s2</code>. Next, <code >s2</code>
is returned, and its new contents are assigned to <code >s1</code>. Note that <code >+=</code>
returns <code >s2</code>.
    <li> at <code >// 2</code> the contents of <code >s3</code> is also added to <code >s2</code>, but as
<code >+=</code> returns <code >s2</code> itself, it's possible to add some more to <code >s2</code>
    <li> at <code >// 3</code> the <code >+</code> operator returns a <code >std::string</code> containing
the concatenation of the text <code >prefix</code> and the contents of <code >s3</code>. This
string returned by the <code >+</code> operator is thereupon assigned to <code >s1</code>.
    <li> at <code >// 4</code> the <code >+</code> operator is applied twice. The effect is:
        <ol>
        <li> The first <code >+</code> returns a <code >std::string</code> containing
the concatenation of the text <code >prefix</code> and the contents of <code >s3</code>.
        <li> The second <code >+</code> operator takes this returned string as its left
hand value, and returns a string containing the concatenated text of its left
and right hand operands.
        <li> The string returned by the second <code >+</code> operator represents the
value of the expression.
        </ol>
    </ul>
<p>
Let's consider the following code, in which a class <code >Binary</code> supports
an overloaded <code >operator+</code>:
        <pre>
    class Binary
    {
        public:
            Binary();
            Binary(int value);
            Binary operator+(Binary const &amp;rhs);
    };

    int main()
    {
        Binary b1;
        Binary b2{ 5 };

        b1 = b2 + 3;            // 1
        b1 = 3 + b2;            // 2
    }
</pre>
    Compilation of this little program fails for statement <code >// 2</code>, with the
compiler reporting an error like:
        <pre>
    error: no match for 'operator+' in '3 + b2'
</pre>
    Why is statement <code >// 1</code> compiled correctly whereas statement <code >// 2</code>
won't compile?
<p>
In order to understand this remember <em >promotions</em>. As we have seen in
section <a href="cplusplus11.html#EXPLICIT">11.4</a>, constructors expecting single arguments may implicitly
be activated when an argument of an appropriate type is provided. We've
already encountered this with <code >std::string</code> objects, where NTBSs may be used
to initialize <code >std::string</code> objects.
<p>
Analogously, in statement <code >// 1</code>, <code >operator+</code> is called, using <code >b2</code>
as its left-hand side operand. This operator expects another <code >Binary</code> object
as its right-hand side operand. However, an <code >int</code> is provided. But as a
constructor <code >Binary(int)</code> exists, the <code >int</code> value can be promoted to a
<code >Binary</code> object. Next, this <code >Binary</code> object is passed as argument to the
<code >operator+</code> member.
<p>
Unfortunately, in statement <code >// 2</code> no promotions are available: here the
<code >+</code> operator is applied to an <code >int</code>-type lvalue. An <code >int</code> is a primitive
type and primitive types have no knowledge of `constructors', `member
functions' or `promotions'.
<p>
How, then, are promotions of left-hand operands implemented in statements
like <code >"prefix " + s3</code>? Since promotions can be applied to function
arguments, we must make sure that both operands of binary operators are
arguments. This implies that plain binary operators supporting promotions for
either their left-hand side operand or right-hand side operand should be
declared as
        <a name="an1109"></a><a name="an1110"></a><em >free operators</em>,
    also called <em >free functions</em>.
<p>
Functions like the plain binary operators conceptually belong to the class
for which they implement these operators. Consequently they should be
declared in the class's header file. We cover their implementations
shortly, but here is our first revision of the declaration of the class
<code >Binary</code>, declaring an overloaded <code >+</code> operator as a free function:
        <pre>
    class Binary
    {
        public:
            Binary();
            Binary(int value);
    };

    Binary operator+(Binary const &amp;lhs, Binary const &amp;rhs);
</pre>
<p>
By defining binary operators as free functions, several promotions are
available:
    <ul>
    <li> If the left-hand operand is of the intended class type, the right
hand argument is promoted whenever possible;
    <li> If the right-hand operand is of the intended class type, the left
hand argument is promoted whenever possible;
    <li> No promotions occur when neither operand is of the intended
class type;
    <li> An ambiguity occurs when promotions to different classes are possible
for the two operands. For example:
        <pre>
    class A;

    class B
    {
        public:
            B(A const &amp;a);
    };

    class A
    {
        public:
            A();
            A(B const &amp;b);
    };

    A operator+(A const &amp;a, B const &amp;b);
    B operator+(B const &amp;b, A const &amp;a);

    int main()
    {
        A a;

        a + a;
    };
</pre>
    Here, both overloaded <code >+</code> operators are possible candidates when
compiling the statement <code >a + a</code>. The ambiguity must be solved by explicitly
promoting one of the arguments, e.g., <code >a + B{a}</code>, which enables the compiler
to resolve the ambiguity to the first overloaded <code >+</code> operator.
    </ul>
<p>
The next step consists of implementing the required overloaded binary
compound assignment operators, having the form <code >@=</code>, where <code >@</code> represents
a binary operator. As these operators <em >always</em> have left-hand side operands
which are object of their own classes, they are implemented as true member
functions. Moreover, compound assignment operators should return references to
the objects for which the binary compound assignment operators were requested,
as these objects might be modified in the same statement. E.g.,
    <code >(s2 += s3) + " postfix"</code>. 
<p>
Here is our second revision of the class <code >Binary</code>, showing both the
declaration of the plain binary operator and the corresponding compound
assignment operator:
        <pre>
    class Binary
    {
        public:
            Binary();
            Binary(int value);

            Binary &amp;operator+=(Binary const &amp;rhs);
    };

    Binary operator+(Binary const &amp;lhs, Binary const &amp;rhs);
</pre>
<p>
How should the compound addition assignment operator be implemented?  When
implementing compound binary assignment operators the strong guarantee should
always be kept in mind: if the operation might throw use a temporary object
and swap. Here is our implementation of the compound assignment operator:
        <pre>
    Binary &amp;Binary::operator+=(Binary const &amp;rhs)
    {
        Binary tmp(*this);
        tmp.add(rhs);           // this might throw
        swap(tmp);
        return *this;
    }
</pre>
<p>
It's easy to implement the free binary operator: the <code >lhs</code> argument is
copied into a <code >Binary tmp</code> to which the <code >rhs</code> operand is added. Then
<code >tmp</code> is returned, using copy elision. The class <code >Binary</code> declares the
free binary operator as a friend, so it can call <code >Binary's add</code> member:
        <pre>
    class Binary
    {
        public:
            Binary();
            Binary(int value);

            Binary &amp;operator+=(Binary const &amp;other);

        private:
            void add(Binary const &amp;other);

        friend Binary operator+(Binary const &amp;lhs, Binary const &amp;rhs);
    };
</pre>
<p>
The binary operator's implementation becomes:
        <pre>
    Binary operator+(Binary const &amp;lhs, Binary const &amp;rhs)
    {
        Binary tmp(lhs);
        tmp.add(rhs);
        return tmp;
    }
</pre>
<p>
If the class <code >Binary</code> is move-aware then it's attractive to add move-aware
binary operators. In this case we also need operators whose left-hand side
operands are rvalue references. When a class is move aware various interesting
implementations are suddenly possible, which we will encounter below and in
the next (sub)section. First have a look at the signature of such a binary
operator (which should also be declared as a friend in the class interface):
        <pre>
    Binary operator+(Binary &amp;&amp;lhs, Binary const &amp;rhs);
</pre>
<p>
Since the lhs operand is an rvalue reference, we can modify it <em >ad lib</em>. 
Binary operators are commonly designed as factory functions, returning objects
created by those operators. Although the <strong >C++</strong> standard does not explicitly
advise against it, it would be a violation of the principle of least surprise
to return that modified lhs operand as an rvalue reference: objects returned
from binary operators should neither be the operators' lhs operand nor the
operators' rhs operand. Instead these operators should return objects created
by them.  But it's OK to use the move constructor to return a copy of a
modified lhs operand.
<p>
Alternatively, the binary operator can first create an object by move
constructing it from the operator's lhs operand. Then directly perform the
binary operation on that object and the operator's rhs operand, and then
return the modified object. It's a matter of taste which one is preferred.
<p>
Here are the two implementations. Because of copy elision the explicitly
defined <code >ret</code> object is created in the location of the return value. Both
implementations, although they appear to be different, show identical run-time
behavior:
        <pre>
                // first implementation: modify lhs
    Binary operator+(Binary &amp;&amp;lhs, Binary const &amp;rhs)   
    {
        lhs.add(rhs);
        return std::move(lhs);
    }
                // second implementation: move construct ret from lhs
    Binary operator+(Binary &amp;&amp;lhs, Binary const &amp;rhs)   
    {
        Binary ret{std::move(lhs)};
        ret.add(rhs);
        return ret;
    }
</pre>
    Now, when executing an expression like (all <code >Binary</code> objects) <code >b1 + b2
+ b3</code> the following functions are called:
        <pre>
    copy operator+          = b1 + b2 
    Copy constructor        = tmp(b1) 
        adding              = tmp.add(b2)
    copy elision            : tmp is returned from b1 + b2
        
    move operator+          = tmp + b3 
    adding                  = tmp.add(b3)
    Move construction       = tmp2(move(tmp)) is returned     
</pre>
<p>
But we're not there yet: in the next section we encounter possibilities
for more  interesting implementations, concentrating on compound assignment
operators. 
<p>
<a name="REFBIND"></a><a name="l212"></a>
<h3 >11.6.1: Member function reference bindings (&amp; and &amp;&amp;)</h3>
    In the previous section we saw that binary operators (like <code >operator+</code>) can
be implemented very efficiently, but still require at least move constructors.
<p>
An expression like
        <pre>
    Binary{} + varB + varC + varD
</pre>
  therefore returns a move constructed object representing <code >Binary{} +
varB</code>, then another move constructed object receiving the first return value
and <code >varC</code>, and finally yet another move constructed object receiving the
second returned object and <code >varD</code> as its arguments.
<p>
Now consider the situation where we have a function defining a <code >Binary &amp;&amp;</code>
parameter, and a second <code >Binary const &amp;</code> parameter. Inside that function
these values need to be added, and their sum is then passed as argument to two
other functions. We <em >could</em> do this:
        <pre>
    void fun1(Binary &amp;&amp;lhs, Binary const &amp;rhs)
    {
        lhs += rhs;
        fun2(lhs);
        fun3(lhs);
    }
</pre>
    But realize that when using <code >operator+=</code> we first construct a copy of
the current object, so a temporary object is available to perform the addition
on, and then swap the temporary object with the current object to commit the
results. But wait! Our lhs operand already <em >is</em> a temporary object. So why
create another?
<p>
In this example there's indeed no need for yet another temporary
object. But different from the binary operators compound assignment operators
don't have an explicitly defined left-hand side operand. In situations like
these we nevertheless can inform the compiler that a member (not just compound
assignment operators) should only be used when the objects calling those
members is an rvalue reference, or an lvalue reference to either a modifiable
or non-modifiable object. For this we use
    <em >reference bindings</em><a name="an1111"></a> a.k.a.  
    <em >reference qualifiers</em><a name="an1112"></a>. 
<p>
Reference bindings consist of a reference token (<code >&amp;</code>), optionally
preceded by <code >const</code>, or an rvalue reference token (<code >&amp;&amp;</code>). Such reference
qualifiers are immediately affixed to the function's head (this applies to the
declaration and the implementation alike). Functions provided with rvalue
reference bindings are selected by the compiler when used by anonymous
temporary objects, whereas functions provided with lvalue reference bindings
are selected by the compiler when used by other types of objects.
<p>
Reference qualifiers allow us to fine-tune our implementations of
<code >operator+=</code>. If we know that the object calling the compound assignment
operator is itself a temporary, then there's no need for a separate temporary
object. The operator may directly perform its operation and then return. Here
is the implementation of <code >operator+=</code> tailored to being used by temporary
objects:
        <pre>
    Binary &amp;&amp;Binary::operator+=(Binary const &amp;rhs) &amp;&amp;
    {
        add(rhs);                   // directly add rhs to *this, 
        return std::move(*this);    // return *this as rvalue ref.
    }
</pre>
    This implementation is about as fast as it gets. 
<p>
For the compound assignment operator called by an lvalue reference (i.e.,
a named object) we use the implementation for <code >operator+=</code> from the previous
section (note the reference qualifier):
        <pre>
    Binary &amp;Binary::operator+=(Binary const &amp;other) &amp;
    {
        Binary tmp(*this);
        tmp.add(other);     // this might throw
        swap(tmp);
        return *this;
    }
</pre>
    With this implementation adding <code >Binary</code> objects to each other
(e.g., <code >b1 += b2 += b3</code>) boils down to
        <pre>
    operator+=    (&amp;)       = b2 += b3
    Copy constructor        = tmp(b2) 
        adding              = tmp.add(b3)
        swap                = b2 &lt;-&gt; tmp
    return                  = b2

    operator+=    (&amp;)       = b1 += b2
    Copy constructor        = tmp(b1) 
        adding              = tmp.add(b2)
        swap                = b1 &lt;-&gt; tmp
    return                  = b1
</pre>
<p>
When the leftmost object is a temporary then a copy construction and swap
call are replaced by the construction of an anonymous object. E.g.,
with <code >Binary{} += b2 += b3</code> we observe:
        <pre>
    operator+=    (&amp;)       = b2 += b3
    Copy constructor        = tmp(b2) 
        adding              = tmp.add(b3)
        swap                = b2 &lt;-&gt; tmp
    
    Anonymous object        = Binary{}

    operator+=    (&amp;&amp;)      = Binary{} += b2
        adding              = add(b2)

    return                  = Binary{}
</pre>
<p>
For <code >Binary &amp;Binary::operator+=(Binary const &amp;other) &amp;</code> an  alternative
implementation exists, using one single return statement, but in fact
requiring two extra function calls. It's a matter of taste whether you prefer
less code to write or executing fewer function calls:  
        <pre>
    Binary &amp;Binary::operator+=(Binary const &amp;other) &amp;
    {
        return *this = Binary{*this} += rhs;
    }
</pre>
    Notice that the implementations of <code >operator+</code> and <code >operator+=</code> are
independent of the actual definition of the class <code >Binary</code>. Adding standard
binary operators to a class (i.e., operators operating on arguments of their
own class types) can therefore easily be realized.

<h2 >11.7: Overloading `operator new(size_t)'</h2>
When <a name="an1113"></a><code >operator new</code><a name="an1114"></a> is overloaded, it must define a <a name="an1115"></a><code >void *</code> return
type, and its first parameter must be of type <a name="an1116"></a><code >size_t</code>. The default
<code >operator new</code> defines only one parameter, but overloaded versions may
define multiple parameters. The first one is not explicitly specified but is
deducted from the size of objects of the class for which <code >operator new</code>
is overloaded. In this section overloading <code >operator new</code> is discussed.
Overloading <a name="an1117"></a><code >new[]</code> is discussed in section <a href="cplusplus11.html#NEWDELETEARRAY">11.9</a>.
<p>
It is possible to define multiple versions of the <code >operator new</code>, as long as
each version defines its own unique set of arguments. When overloaded
<code >operator new</code> members must dynamically allocate memory they can do so using
the global <code >operator new</code>, applying the scope resolution operator
<code >::</code>. In the next example the overloaded <code >operator new</code> of the class
<code >String</code> initializes the substrate of dynamically allocated <code >String</code>
objects to 0-bytes:
        <pre>
    #include &lt;cstring&gt;
    #include &lt;iosfwd&gt;

    class String
    {
        std::string *d_data;

        public:
            void *operator new(size_t size)
            {
                return memset(::operator new(size), 0, size);
            }
            bool empty() const
            {
                return d_data == 0;
            }
    };
</pre>
    The above <code >operator new</code> is used in the following program, illustrating
that even though <code >String</code>'s default constructor does nothing the object's
data member <code >d_data</code> is initialized to zero:
        <pre>
    #include "string.h"
    #include &lt;iostream&gt;
    using namespace std;

    int main()
    {
        String *sp = new String;

        cout &lt;&lt; boolalpha &lt;&lt; sp-&gt;empty() &lt;&lt; '\n';   // shows: true
    }
</pre>
    At <code >new String</code> the following took place:
    <ul>
    <li> First, <code >String::operator new</code> was called, allocating and
initializing a block of memory, the size of a <code >String</code> object.
    <li> Next, a pointer to this block of memory was passed to the
        (default) <code >String</code> constructor. Since no constructor was defined,
        the constructor itself didn't do anything at all.
    </ul>
    As <code >String::operator new</code> initialized the allocated memory to zero bytes
the allocated <code >String</code> object's <code >d_data</code> member had already been
initialized to a 0-pointer by the time it started to exist.
<p>
All member functions (including constructors and destructors) we've
encountered so far define a (hidden) pointer to the object on which they
should operate. This hidden pointer becomes the function's <a name="an1118"></a><code >this</code> pointer.
<p>
In the next example of <em >pseudo</em> <strong >C++</strong> <em >code</em>, the pointer is explicitly
shown to illustrate what's happening when <code >operator new</code> is used. In the
first part a <code >String</code> object <code >str</code> is directly defined, in the second
part of the example the (overloaded) <code >operator new</code> is used:
        <pre>
    String::String(String *const this);     // real prototype of the default
                                            // constructor

    String *sp = new String;                // This statement is implemented
                                            // as follows:

        String *sp = static_cast&lt;String *&gt;(            // allocation
                        String::operator new(sizeof(String))
                     );
        String::String(sp);                                 // initialization
</pre>
    In the above fragment the member functions were treated as
 <em >object-less</em> member functions of the class <code >String</code>. Such members are
called <em >static member functions</em> (cf. chapter <a href="cplusplus08.html#StaticDataFun">8</a>). Actually,
<code >operator new</code> <em >is</em> such a static member function. Since it has no
<code >this</code> pointer it cannot reach data members of the object for which it is
expected to make memory available. It can only allocate and initialize the
allocated memory, but cannot reach the object's data members by name as there
is as yet no data object layout defined.
<p>
Following the allocation, the memory is passed (as the <code >this</code> pointer)
to the constructor for further processing.
<p>
<code >Operator new</code> can have multiple parameters. The first parameter is
initialized as an implicit argument and is always a <code >size_t</code>
parameter. Additional overloaded operators may define additional
parameters. An interesting additional <code >operator new</code> is the
    <a name="an1119"></a><a name="an1120"></a><em >placement new</em> operator. With the placement new
operator a block of memory has already been set aside and one of the class's
constructors is used to initialize that memory. Overloading placement new
requires an <code >operator new</code> having two parameters: <code >size_t</code> and <code >char *</code>,
pointing to the memory that was already available. The <code >size_t</code>
parameter is implicitly initialized, but the remaining parameters must
explicitly be initialized using arguments to <code >operator new</code>. Hence we reach
the familiar syntactical form of the placement new operator in use:
        <pre>
    char buffer[sizeof(String)];        // predefined memory
    String *sp = new(buffer) String;    // placement new call
</pre>
    The declaration of the placement new operator in our class <code >String</code>
looks like this:
        <pre>
    void *operator new(size_t size, char *memory);
</pre>
    It could be implemented like this (also initializing the <code >String</code>'s
memory to 0-bytes):
        <pre>
    void *String::operator new(size_t size, char *memory)
    {
        return memset(memory, 0, size);
    }
</pre>
    Any other overloaded version of <code >operator new</code> could also be
defined. Here is an example showing the use and definition of an overloaded
<code >operator new</code> storing the object's address immediately in an existing array
of pointers to <code >String</code> objects (assuming the array is large enough):
        <pre>
        // use:
    String *next(String **pointers, size_t *idx)
    {
        return new(pointers, (*idx)++) String;
    }

        // implementation:
    void *String::operator new(size_t size, String **pointers, size_t idx)
    {
        return pointers[idx] = ::operator new(size);
    }
</pre>
<p>
<a name="OVERLOADDELETE"></a><a name="l214"></a>
<h2 >11.8: Overloading `operator delete(void *)'</h2>
The <a name="an1121"></a><code >delete</code> operator may also be overloaded. In fact it's good practice to
overload <a name="an1122"></a><code >operator delete</code> whenever <code >operator new</code> is also overloaded.
<p>
<code >Operator delete</code> must define a <a name="an1123"></a><code >void *</code> parameter.  A second overloaded
version defining a second parameter of type <code >size_t</code> is related to
overloading <code >operator new[]</code> and is discussed in section
<a href="cplusplus11.html#NEWDELETEARRAY">11.9</a>.
<p>
Overloaded <code >operator delete</code> members return <code >void</code>.
<p>
The `home-made' <code >operator delete</code> is called when deleting a dynamically
allocated object after executing the destructor of the associated
class. So, the statement
        <pre>
    delete ptr;
</pre>
    with <code >ptr</code> being a pointer to an object of the class <code >String</code> for
which the operator <code >delete</code> was overloaded, is a shorthand for the following
statements:
        <pre>
    ptr-&gt;~String(); // call the class's destructor

                    // and do things with the memory pointed to by ptr
    String::operator delete(ptr);
</pre>
    The overloaded <code >operator delete</code> may do whatever it wants to do with the
memory pointed to by <code >ptr</code>. It could, e.g., simply delete it. If that would
be the preferred thing to do, then the default
<code >delete</code> operator can be called using the <a name="an1124"></a><code >::</code>
 <a name="an1125"></a>scope resolution operator. For example:
        <pre>
    void String::operator delete(void *ptr)
    {
        // any operation considered necessary, then, maybe:
        ::delete ptr;
    }
</pre>
    To declare the above overloaded <code >operator delete</code> simply add the
following line to the class's interface:
        <pre>
    void operator delete(void *ptr);
</pre>
    Like <code >operator new operator delete</code> is a static member function
(see also chapter <a href="cplusplus08.html#StaticDataFun">8</a>).
<p>
<a name="NEWDELETEARRAY"></a><a name="l215"></a>
<h2 >11.9: Operators `new[]' and `delete[]'</h2>
In sections <a href="cplusplus09.html#NEWARRAY">9.1.1</a>, <a href="cplusplus09.html#DELETEARRAY">9.1.2</a> and <a href="cplusplus09.html#DELETEPTRS">9.2.1</a>
    <code >operator new[]</code> and <code >operator delete[]</code> were introduced.  Like
<code >operator new</code> and <code >operator delete</code> the
operators <code >new[]</code> and <code >delete[]</code> may be overloaded.
<p>
As it is possible to overload <code >new[]</code> and <code >delete[]</code> as well as
<code >operator new</code> and <code >operator delete</code>, one should be careful in selecting
the appropriate set of operators. The following <a name="an1126"></a>rule of thumb should always
be applied:
    <blockquote >If <code >new</code> is used to <a name="an1127"></a>allocate memory, <code >delete</code> should be used
        to <a name="an1128"></a>deallocate memory. If <code >new[]</code> is used to allocate memory,
        <code >delete[]</code> should be used to deallocate memory.</blockquote>
<p>
By default these operators act as follows:
    <ul>
    <li><code >operator new</code> is used to allocate a single object or
        primitive value. With an object, the object's constructor is
called.
    <li><code >operator delete</code> is used to return the memory allocated by <code >operator
new</code>. Again, with class-type objects, the class's destructor is
called.
    <li><code >operator new[]</code> is used to allocate a series of primitive values or
objects. If a series of objects is allocated, the class's default constructor
is called to initialize each object individually.
    <li><code >operator delete[]</code> is used to delete the memory previously allocated
by <code >new[]</code>. <em >If</em> objects were previously allocated, then the destructor
is called for each individual object. Be careful, though, when pointers to
objects were allocated. If <a name="an1129"></a>
 <em >pointers to objects</em> were allocated the destructors of the objects to
which the allocated pointers point won't automatically be called. A pointer is
a primitive type and so no further action is taken when it is returned to the
common pool.
    </ul>
<p>
<a name="l216"></a>
<h3 >11.9.1: Overloading `new[]'</h3>
        To overload <a name="an1130"></a><code >operator new[]</code> in a class (e.g., in the class
<code >String</code>) add the following line to the class's interface:
        <pre>
    void *operator new[](size_t size);
</pre>
    The member's <code >size</code> parameter is implicitly provided and is initialized
by <strong >C++</strong>'s run-time system to the amount of memory that must be allocated.
Like the simple one-object <code >operator new</code> it
should return a <a name="an1131"></a><code >void *</code>. The number of objects that must be initialized can
easily be computed from <code >size / sizeof(String)</code> (and of course replacing
<code >String</code> by the appropriate class name when overloading <code >operator new[]</code>
for another class). The overloaded <code >new[]</code> member may allocate raw memory
using e.g., the default <code >operator new[]</code> or the default <code >operator new</code>:
        <pre>
    void *operator new[](size_t size)
    {
        return ::operator new[](size);
        // alternatively:
        // return ::operator new(size);
    }
</pre>
    Before returning the allocated memory the overloaded <code >operator new[]</code>
has a chance to do something special. It could, e.g., initialize the memory to
zero-bytes.
<p>
Once the overloaded <code >operator new[]</code> has been defined, it is
automatically used in statements like:
        <pre>
    String *op = new String[12];
</pre>
    Like <code >operator new</code> additional overloads of <code >operator new[]</code> may be
defined. One opportunity for an <code >operator new[]</code> overload is overloading
 <a name="an1132"></a><em >placement new</em> specifically for arrays of objects. This operator is
available by default but becomes  unavailable once at least one overloaded
<code >operator new[]</code> is defined. Implementing placement <code >new</code> is not
difficult. Here is an example, initializing the available memory to 0-bytes
before returning:
        <pre>
    void *String::operator new[](size_t size, char *memory)
    {
        return memset(memory, 0, size);
    }
</pre>
    To use this overloaded operator, the second parameter must again be
provided, as in:
        <pre>
    char buffer[12 * sizeof(String)];
    String *sp = new(buffer) String[12];
</pre>
<p>
<a name="l217"></a>
<h3 >11.9.2: Overloading `delete[]'</h3>
    To overload <a name="an1133"></a><code >operator delete[]</code> in a class <code >String</code> add the following line
to the class's interface:
        <pre>
    void operator delete[](void *memory);
</pre>
    Its parameter is initialized to the address of a block of memory
previously allocated by <code >String::new[]</code>.
<p>
There are some subtleties to be aware of when implementing
<code >operator delete[]</code>. Although the addresses returned by <code >new</code> and
<code >new[]</code> point to the allocated object(s), there is an additional <code >size_t</code>
value available immediately before the address returned by <code >new</code> and
<code >new[]</code>. This <code >size_t</code> value is part of the allocated block and contains
the actual size of the block. This of course does not hold true for the
 <a name="an1134"></a>placement <code >new</code> operator.
<p>
When a class defines a destructor the <code >size_t</code> value preceding the
address returned by <code >new[]</code> does not contain the size of the allocated
block, but the <em >number</em> of objects specified when calling
<code >new[]</code>. Normally that is of no interest, but when overloading <code >operator
delete[]</code> it might become a useful piece of information. In those cases
<code >operator delete[]</code> does <em >not</em> receive the address returned by <code >new[]</code>
but rather the address of the initial <code >size_t</code> value. Whether this is at all
useful is not clear. By the time <code >delete[]</code>'s code is executed all objects
have already been destroyed, so <code >operator delete[]</code> is only to determine how
many objects were destroyed but the objects themselves cannot be used anymore.
<p>
Here is an example showing this behavior of <code >operator delete[]</code> for a
minimal <code >Demo</code> class:
        <pre>
    struct Demo
    {
        size_t idx;
        Demo()
        {
            cout &lt;&lt; "default cons\n";
        }
        ~Demo()
        {
            cout &lt;&lt; "destructor\n";
        }
        void *operator new[](size_t size)
        {
            return ::operator new(size);
        }
        void operator delete[](void *vp)
        {
            cout &lt;&lt; "delete[] for: " &lt;&lt; vp &lt;&lt; '\n';
            ::operator delete[](vp);
        }
    };

    int main()
    {
        Demo *xp;
        cout &lt;&lt; ((int *)(xp = new Demo[3]))[-1] &lt;&lt; '\n';
        cout &lt;&lt; xp &lt;&lt; '\n';
        cout &lt;&lt; "==================\n";
        delete[] xp;
    }
    // This program displays (your 0x?????? addresses might differ, but
    // the difference between the two should be sizeof(size_t)):
    //  default cons
    //  default cons
    //  default cons
    //  3
    //  0x8bdd00c
    //  ==================
    //  destructor
    //  destructor
    //  destructor
    //  delete[] for: 0x8bdd008
</pre>
    Having overloaded <code >operator delete[]</code> for a class <code >String</code>, it will be
used automatically in statements like:
        <pre>
        delete[] new String[5];
</pre>
<p>
Operator <code >delete[]</code> may also be overloaded using an additional
<code >size_t</code> parameter:
        <pre>
    void operator delete[](void *p, size_t size);
</pre>
    Here <code >size</code> is automatically initialized to the size (in bytes) of the
block of memory to which <code >void *p</code> points. If this form is defined, then
<code >void operator[](void *)</code> should <em >not</em> be defined, to avoid ambiguities.
An example of this latter form of <code >operator delete[]</code> is:
        <pre>
    void String::operator delete[](void *p, size_t size)
    {
        cout &lt;&lt; "deleting " &lt;&lt; size &lt;&lt; " bytes\n";
        ::operator delete[](ptr);
    }
</pre>
<p>
Additional overloads of <code >operator delete[]</code> may be defined, but to use
them they must explicitly be called as static member functions (cf. chapter
<a href="cplusplus08.html#StaticDataFun">8</a>). Example:
        <pre>
        // declaration:
    void String::operator delete[](void *p, ostream &amp;out);
        // usage:
    String *xp = new String[3];
    String::operator delete[](xp, cout);
</pre>
<p>
<a name="l218"></a>
<h3 >11.9.3: The `operator delete(void *, size_t)' family</h3>
    As we've seen classes may overload their <code >operator delete</code> and <code >operator
delete[]</code> members. 
<p>
Since the C++14 standard the global <code >void operator delete(void *, size_t
size)</code> and <code >void operator delete[](void *, size_t size)</code> functions can also
be overloaded.
<p>
When a global <a name="an1135"></a>sized deallocation function is defined, it is automatically
used instead of the default, non-sized deallocation function. The performance
of programs may improve if a sized deallocation function is available (cf. 
<a href="http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2013/n3663.html">http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2013/n3663.html</a>).

<h3 >11.9.4: `new[]', `delete[]' and exceptions</h3>
    When an exception is thrown while executing a <code >new[]</code> expression, what will
happen? In this section we'll show that <code >new[]</code> is
 <a name="an1136"></a><a name="an1137"></a> exception safe even when
only some of the objects were properly constructed.
<p>
To begin, <code >new[]</code> might throw while trying to allocate the required
memory. In this case a <a name="an1138"></a><code >bad_alloc</code> is thrown and we don't leak as nothing
was allocated.
<p>
Having allocated the required memory the class's default constructor is going
to be used for each of the objects in turn. At some point a constructor might
throw. What happens next is defined by the <strong >C++</strong> standard: the destructors
of the already constructed objects are called and the memory allocated for
the objects themselves is returned to the common pool. Assuming that the
failing constructor offers the basic guarantee <code >new[]</code> is therefore
exception safe even if a constructor may throw.
<p>
The following example illustrates this behavior. A request to allocate and
initialize five objects is made, but after constructing two objects
construction fails by throwing an exception. The output shows that the
destructors of properly constructed objects are called and that the allocated
<em >substrate memory</em> is properly returned:
    <pre>
    #include &lt;iostream&gt;
    using namespace std;

    static size_t count = 0;

    class X
    {
        int x;

        public:
            X()
            {
                if (count == 2)
                    throw 1;
                cout &lt;&lt; "Object " &lt;&lt; ++count &lt;&lt; '\n';
            }
            ~X()
            {
                cout &lt;&lt; "Destroyed " &lt;&lt; this &lt;&lt; "\n";
            }
            void *operator new[](size_t size)
            {
                cout &lt;&lt; "Allocating objects: " &lt;&lt; size &lt;&lt; " bytes\n";
                return ::operator new(size);
            }
            void operator delete[](void *mem)
            {
                cout &lt;&lt; "Deleting memory at " &lt;&lt; mem &lt;&lt; ", containing: " &lt;&lt;
                    *static_cast&lt;int *&gt;(mem) &lt;&lt; "\n";
                ::operator delete(mem);
            }
    };

    int main()
    try
    {
        X *xp = new X[5];
        cout &lt;&lt; "Memory at " &lt;&lt; xp &lt;&lt; '\n';
        delete[] xp;
    }
    catch (...)

<h2 >11.10: Function Objects</h2>
<em >Function Objects</em> are created by overloading the
 <a name="an1139"></a><em >function call operator</em> <a name="an1140"></a><code >operator()</code>. By defining the function call
operator an object masquerades as a function, hence the term
        <a name="an1141"></a> <em >function objects</em>.
    Function objects are also known as
        <a name="an1142"></a><em >functors</em>.
<p>
Function objects are important when using
    <a href="cplusplus19.html#GENERIC"><em >generic algorithms</em></a>. The use of function objects is
preferred over alternatives like
 <a name="an1143"></a> pointers to functions. The fact that they are
important in the context of generic algorithms leaves us with a didactic
dilemma. At this point in the <strong >C++</strong> Annotations it would have been nice if generic
algorithms would already have been covered, but for the discussion of the
generic algorithms knowledge of function objects is required. This
bootstrapping problem is solved in a well known way: by ignoring the
dependency for the time being, for now concentrating on the function object
concept.
<p>
Function objects are objects for which <code >operator()</code> has been
defined. Function objects are not just used in combination with generic
algorithms, but also as a (preferred) alternative to pointers to
functions.
<p>
Function objects are frequently used to implement
 <a name="an1144"></a><em >predicate</em> functions.  Predicate functions return boolean values.
Predicate functions and predicate function objects are commonly referred to as
`predicates'. Predicates are frequently used by generic algorithms such as the
<a href="cplusplus19.html#COUNTIF">count_if</a> generic algorithm, covered in chapter <a href="cplusplus19.html#GENERIC">19</a>,
returning the number of times its function object has returned <code >true</code>. In
the <em >standard template library</em> two kinds of predicates are used: <em >unary
predicates</em> receive one argument, <em >binary predicates</em> receive two arguments.
<p>
Assume we have a class <code >Person</code> and an array of <code >Person</code> objects. Further
assume that the array is not sorted. A well known procedure for finding a
particular <code >Person</code> object in the array is to use the function <a name="an1145"></a>
<a name="an1146"></a><code >lsearch</code>, which performs a <a name="an1147"></a><em >lineair search</em> in an array. Example:
        <pre>
    Person &amp;target = targetPerson();    // determine the person to find
    Person *pArray;
    size_t n = fillPerson(&amp;pArray);

    cout &lt;&lt; "The target person is";

    if (!lsearch(&amp;target, pArray, &amp;n, sizeof(Person), compareFunction))
        cout &lt;&lt; " not";
    cout &lt;&lt; "found\n";
</pre>
    The function <code >targetPerson</code> determines the person we're looking for, and
<code >fillPerson</code> is called to fill the array.  Then <code >lsearch</code> is used to
locate the target person.
<p>
The comparison function must be available, as its address is one of the
arguments of <code >lsearch</code>. It must be a real function having an address. If it
is defined inline then the compiler has no choice but to ignore that request
as inline functions don't have addresses. <code >CompareFunction</code> could be
implemented like this:
        <pre>
    int compareFunction(void const *p1, void const *p2)
    {
        return *static_cast&lt;Person const *&gt;(p1)     // lsearch wants 0
                !=                                  // for equal objects
                *static_cast&lt;Person const *&gt;(p2);
    }
</pre>
    This, of course, assumes that the <a name="an1148"></a><code >operator!=</code> has been overloaded in
the class <code >Person</code>. But overloading <code >operator!=</code> is no big deal, so
let's assume that that operator is actually available.
<p>
On average <code >n / 2</code> times <em >at least</em> the
following actions take place:
    <ol>
    <li> The two arguments of the compare function are pushed on the stack;
    <li> The value of the final parameter of <code >lsearch</code> is determined,
producing <code >compareFunction</code>'s address;
    <li> The compare function is called;
    <li> Then, inside the compare function the address of the right-hand
argument of the 
        <code >Person::operator!=</code> argument is pushed on the stack;
    <li> <code >Person::operator!=</code> is evaluated;
    <li> The argument of the <code >Person::operator!=</code> function is popped off
the stack;
    <li> The two arguments of the compare function are popped off the stack.
    </ol>
    Using function objects results in a different picture. Assume we have
constructed a function <code >PersonSearch</code>, having the following prototype (this,
however, is not the preferred approach. Normally a generic algorithm is
preferred over a home-made function. But for now we focus on <code >PersonSearch</code>
to illustrate the use and implementation of a function object):
        <pre>
    Person const *PersonSearch(Person *base, size_t nmemb,
                               Person const &amp;target);
</pre>
    This function can be used as follows:
        <pre>
    Person &amp;target = targetPerson();
    Person *pArray;
    size_t n = fillPerson(&amp;pArray);

    cout &lt;&lt; "The target person is";

    if (!PersonSearch(pArray, n, target))
        cout &lt;&lt; " not";

    cout &lt;&lt; "found\n";
</pre>
    So far, not much has been changed. We've replaced the call to <code >lsearch</code>
with a call to another function: <code >PersonSearch</code>.  Now look at
<code >PersonSearch</code> itself:
        <pre>
    Person const *PersonSearch(Person *base, size_t nmemb,
                                Person const &amp;target)
    {
        for (int idx = 0; idx &lt; nmemb; ++idx)
            if (target(base[idx]))
                return base + idx;
        return 0;
    }
</pre>
    <code >PersonSearch</code> implements a plain <a name="an1149"></a>linear search. However, in the
for-loop we see <code >target(base[idx])</code>. Here <code >target</code> is used as a
<em >function object</em>. Its implementation is simple:
        <pre>
    bool Person::operator()(Person const &amp;other) const
    {
        return *this == other;
    }
</pre>
    Note the somewhat <a name="an1150"></a>peculiar syntax: <a name="an1151"></a><code >operator()</code>. The first set of
parentheses define the operator that is overloaded: the function call
operator. The second set of parentheses define the parameters that are
required for this overloaded operator. In the class header file this
overloaded operator is declared as:
        <pre>
    bool operator()(Person const &amp;other) const;
</pre>
    Clearly <code >Person::operator()</code> is a simple function. It contains but one
statement, and we could consider defining it <a name="an1152"></a>inline. Assuming we do,
then this is what happens when <code >operator()</code> is called:
    <ol>
    <li> The address of the right-hand argument of the
        <code >Person::operator==</code> argument is pushed on the stack;
    <li> The <code >operator==</code> function is evaluated (which probably also is a
<em >semantic</em> improvement over calling <code >operator!=</code> when looking for an
object <em >equal to</em> a specified target object);
    <li> The argument of <code >Person::operator==</code> argument is popped off the
        stack.
    </ol>
    Due to the fact that <code >operator()</code> is an inline function, it is not
actually called. Instead <code >operator==</code> is called immediately. Moreover, the
required <a name="an1153"></a>stack operations are fairly modest.
<p>
Function objects may truly be defined inline.  Functions that are called
indirectly (i.e., using pointers to functions) can never be defined inline as
their addresses must be known.  Therefore, even if the function object needs
to do very little work it is defined as an ordinary function if it is going to
be called through pointers. The overhead of performing the indirect call may
annihilate the advantage of the flexibility of calling functions
indirectly. In these cases using inline function objects can result in an
increase of a program's efficiency.
<p>
An added benefit of function objects is that they may access the private data
of their objects. In a search algorithm where a compare function is used (as
with <code >lsearch</code>) the target and array elements are passed to the compare
function using pointers, involving extra stack handling. Using function
objects, the target person doesn't vary within a single search
task. Therefore, the target person could be passed to the function object's
class constructor. This is in fact what happens in the expression
<code >target(base[idx])</code> receiving as its only argument the subsequent elements
of the array to search.
<p>
<a name="MANIPCONSTRUCTION"></a><a name="l221"></a>
<h3 >11.10.1: Constructing manipulators</h3>
    In chapter <a href="cplusplus06.html#IOStreams">6</a> we saw constructions like <code >cout</code> &lt;&lt; <code >hex</code>
&lt;&lt; <code >13</code> &lt;&lt; to display the value 13 in hexadecimal format. One
may wonder by what magic the <code >hex</code> <a name="an1154"></a>manipulator accomplishes this. In this
section the construction of manipulators like <code >hex</code> is covered.
<p>
Actually the construction of a manipulator is rather simple. To start, a
definition of the manipulator is needed. Let's assume we want to create a
manipulator <code >w10</code> which sets the <a name="an1155"></a>field width of the next field to be
written by the <code >ostream</code> object to 10. This manipulator is constructed as a
function. The <code >w10</code> function needs to know about the <code >ostream</code> object
in which the width must be set. By providing the function with an <code >ostream
&amp;</code> parameter, it obtains this knowledge. Now that the function knows about the
<code >ostream</code> object we're referring to, it can set the width in that object.
<p>
Next, it must be possible to use the manipulator in an insertion
sequence. This implies that the <a name="an1156"></a>return value of the manipulator must be
a <a name="an1157"></a>reference to an <a name="an1158"></a><code >ostream</code> object also.
<p>
From the above considerations we're now able to construct our <code >w10</code>
function:
        <pre>
    #include &lt;ostream&gt;
    #include &lt;iomanip&gt;

    std::ostream &amp;w10(std::ostream &amp;str)
    {
        return str &lt;&lt; std::setw(10);
    }
</pre>
    The <code >w10</code> function can of course be used in a `stand alone' mode, but it
can also be used as a manipulator. E.g.,
    <pre>
        #include &lt;iostream&gt;
        #include &lt;iomanip&gt;

        using namespace std;

        extern ostream &amp;w10(ostream &amp;str);

        int main()
        {
            w10(cout) &lt;&lt; 3 &lt;&lt; " ships sailed to America\n";
            cout &lt;&lt; "And " &lt;&lt; w10 &lt;&lt; 3 &lt;&lt; " more ships sailed too.\n";
        }
</pre>
        The <code >w10</code> function can be used as a manipulator because the <code >class
ostream</code> has an overloaded <code >operator</code>&lt;&lt; accepting a <a name="an1159"></a>pointer to a function
expecting an <code >ostream &amp;</code> and returning an <code >ostream &amp;</code>. Its definition is:
        <pre>
    ostream&amp; operator&lt;&lt;(ostream &amp;(*func)(ostream &amp;str))
    {
        return (*func)(*this);
    }
</pre>
    In addition to the above overloaded <code >operator</code>&lt;&lt; another one is defined
        <pre>
    ios_base &amp;operator&lt;&lt;(ios_base &amp;(*func)(ios_base &amp;base))
    {
        (*func)(*this);
        return *this;
    }
</pre>
    This latter function is used when inserting, e.g., <code >hex</code> or
<code >internal</code>.
<p>
The above procedure does not work for manipulators requiring arguments.
It is of course possible to overload <code >operator</code>&lt;&lt; to accept an <code >ostream</code>
reference and the address of a function expecting an <code >ostream &amp;</code> and, e.g.,
an <code >int</code>, but while the address of such a function may be specified with the
&lt;&lt;-operator, the arguments itself cannot be specified. So, one wonders
how the following construction has been implemented:
        <pre>
    cout &lt;&lt; setprecision(3)
</pre>
    In this case the manipulator is defined as a <a name="an1160"></a>macro. Macro's, however,
are the realm of the <a name="an1161"></a>preprocessor, and may easily suffer from unwelcome
side-effects. In <strong >C++</strong> programs they should be avoided whenever
possible. The following section introduces a way to implement manipulators
requiring arguments without resorting to macros, but using
 <a name="an1162"></a> anonymous objects.
<p>
<a name="l222"></a>
<h4>11.10.1.1: Manipulators requiring arguments</h4>
        Manipulators taking arguments are implemented as <a name="an1163"></a> macros: they are
handled by the <a name="an1164"></a>preprocessor, and are not available beyond the preprocessing
stage.  The problem appears to be that you can't call a function in an
insertion sequence: when using multiple <code >operator</code>&lt;&lt; operators in one statement
the compiler calls the functions, saves their return values, and then
uses their return values in the insertion sequence. That invalidates the
ordering of the arguments passed to your &lt;&lt;-operators.
<p>
So, one might consider constructing another overloaded <code >operator</code>&lt;&lt; accepting
the address of a function receiving not just the <a name="an1165"></a><code >ostream</code> reference, but a
series of other arguments as well. But this creates the problem that it isn't
clear how the function should receive its arguments: you can't just call it
since that takes us back to the above-mentioned problem.  Merely passing its
address is fine, but then no arguments can be passed to the function.
<p>
There exists a solution, based on the use of <a name="an1166"></a> anonymous
objects:
    <ul>
    <li> First, a class is constructed, e.g. <code >Align</code>, whose
<a name="an1167"></a>constructor expects multiple arguments. In our example representing,
respectively, the field width and the alignment.
    <li> Furthermore, we define the function:
        <pre>
    ostream &amp;operator&lt;&lt;(ostream &amp;ostr, Align const &amp;align)
</pre>
        so we can insert an <code >Align</code> object into the ostream.
    </ul>
    Here is an example of a little program using such a <em >home-made</em>
manipulator expecting multiple arguments:
        <pre>
    #include &lt;iostream&gt;
    #include &lt;iomanip&gt;

    class Align
    {
        unsigned d_width;
        std::ios::fmtflags d_alignment;

        public:
            Align(unsigned width, std::ios::fmtflags alignment);
            std::ostream &amp;operator()(std::ostream &amp;ostr) const;
    };

    Align::Align(unsigned width, std::ios::fmtflags alignment)
    :
        d_width(width),
        d_alignment(alignment)
    {}

    std::ostream &amp;Align::operator()(std::ostream &amp;ostr) const
    {
        ostr.setf(d_alignment, std::ios::adjustfield);
        return ostr &lt;&lt; std::setw(d_width);
    }

    std::ostream &amp;operator&lt;&lt;(std::ostream &amp;ostr, Align const &amp;align)
    {
        return align(ostr);
    }

    using namespace std;

    int main()
    {
        cout
            &lt;&lt; "`" &lt;&lt; Align{ 5, ios::left } &lt;&lt; "hi" &lt;&lt; "'"
            &lt;&lt; "`" &lt;&lt; Align{ 10, ios::right } &lt;&lt; "there" &lt;&lt; "'\n";
    }

    /*
        Generated output:

        `hi   '`     there'
    */
</pre>
    Note that in order to insert an anonymous <code >Align</code> object into the
<code >ostream</code>, the <code >operator</code>&lt;&lt; function <em >must</em> define an <code >Align const &amp;</code>
parameter (note the <code >const</code> modifier).
<p>
<a name="EnumOverload"></a><a name="l223"></a>
<h2 >11.11: The case of [io]fstream::open()</h2>
Earlier, in section <a href="cplusplus06.html#OUTPUTMODES">6.4.2.1</a>, it was noted that the
<code >[io]fstream::open</code> members expect an <code >ios::openmode</code> value as their
final argument. E.g., to open an <code >fstream</code> object for writing you could do
as follows:
        <pre>
    fstream out;
    out.open("/tmp/out", ios::out);
</pre>
    Combinations are also possible. To open an <code >fstream</code> object for
<em >both</em> reading and writing the following stanza is often seen:
        <pre>
    fstream out;
    out.open("/tmp/out", ios::in | ios::out);
</pre>
<p>
When trying to combine enum values using a `home made' <code >enum</code> we may run
into problems. Consider the following:
        <pre>
    enum Permission
    {
        READ =      1 &lt;&lt; 0,
        WRITE =     1 &lt;&lt; 1,
        EXECUTE =   1 &lt;&lt; 2
    };

    void setPermission(Permission permission);

    int main()
    {
        setPermission(READ | WRITE);
    }
</pre>
    When offering this little program to the compiler it replies with an
error message like this:
    <div style="text-align: center"><code >invalid conversion from 'int' to 'Permission'</code></div>
<p>
The question is of course: why is it OK to combine <code >ios::openmode</code>
values passing these combined values to the stream's <code >open</code> member, but
not OK to combine <code >Permission</code> values.
<p>
<a name="an1168"></a>
    Combining enum values using arithmetic operators results in <code >int</code>-typed
values. <em >Conceptually</em> this never was our intention. Conceptually it can be
considered correct to combine enum values if the resulting value conceptually
makes sense as a value that is still within the original enumeration
domain. Note that after adding a value <code >READWRITE = READ | WRITE</code> to the
above <code >enum</code> we're still not allowed to specify <code >READ | WRITE</code> as an
argument to <code >setPermission</code>.
<p>
To answer the question about combining enumeration values and yet stay
within the enumeration's domain we turn to operator overloading. Up to this
point operator overloading has been applied to class types. Free functions
like <code >operator&lt;&lt;</code> have been overloaded, and those overloads are conceptually
within the domain of their class.
<p>
As <strong >C++</strong> is a strongly typed language realize that defining an <code >enum</code> is
really something beyond the mere association of <code >int</code>-values with symbolic
names. An enumeration type is really a type of its own, and as with any type
its operators can be overloaded. When writing <code >READ | WRITE</code> the compiler
performs the default conversion from enum values to <code >int</code> values and
applies the operator to <code >ints</code>. It does so when it has no alternative.
<p>
But it is also possible to overload the enum type's operators. Thus we may
ensure that we'll remain within the enum's domain even though the resulting
value wasn't defined by the enum. The advantage of type-safety and conceptual
clarity is considered to outweigh the somewhat peculiar introduction of values
hitherto not defined by the enum.
<p>
Here is an example of such an overloaded operator:
        <pre>
    Permission operator|(Permission left, Permission right)
    {
        return static_cast&lt;Permission&gt;(static_cast&lt;int&gt;(left) | right);
    }
</pre>
    Other operators can easily and analogously be constructed.
<p>
Operators like the above were defined for the  <code >ios::openmode</code>
enumeration type, allowing us to specify <code >ios::in | ios::out</code> as argument to
<code >open</code> while specifying the corresponding parameter as <code >ios::openmode</code>
as well. Clearly, operator overloading can be used in many situations, not
necessarily only involving class-types.
<p>
<a name="UDLITERALS"></a><a name="l224"></a>
<h2 >11.12: User-defined literals</h2>
In addition to the well-known literals, like numerical constants (with or
without suffixes), character constants and string (textual) literals, <strong >C++</strong>
also supports
    <a name="an1169"></a><em >user-defined literals</em>, also known as <a name="an1170"></a><em >extensible literals</em>. 
<p>
A user-defined literal is defined by a function (see also section <a href="cplusplus23.html#UDL">23.3</a>)
that must be defined at namespace scope. Such a function is called a
        <a name="an1171"></a>literal operator.
    A literal operator cannot be a class member function.  The names of a
literal operator must start with an
    <a name="an1172"></a> underscore, and a literal operator is
used (called) by <em >suffixing</em> its name (including the underscore) to the
argument that must be passed to it . Assuming <code >_NM2km</code> (nautical mile to km)
is the name of a literal operator, then it could be called as <code >100_NM2km</code>,
producing, e.g., the value 185.2.
<p>
Using <code >Type</code> to represent the return type of the literal operator
its generic declaration looks like this:
        <pre>
    Type operator "" _identifier(parameter-list);
</pre>
    The blank space trailing the empty string is required. The parameter lists
of literal operators can be:
    <ul>
    <li><code >unsigned long long int</code>. It is used as, e.g., <code >123_identifier</code>. The
        argument to this literal operator can be decimal constants,
        binary constants (initial <a name="an1173"></a>0b), octal constants (initial 0) and
        hexadecimal constants (initial 0x);
    <li><code >long double</code>. It is used as, e.g., <code >12.25_NM2km</code>;
    <li><code >char const *text</code>. The <code >text</code> argument is an NTBS. It is
        used as, e.g., <code >1234_pental</code>. The argument must <em >not</em> be given
        double quotes, and must represent a numeric constant, as also expected
        by literal operators defining  <code >unsigned long long int</code>
        parameters.
    <li><code >char const *text, size_t len</code>. Here, the compiler determines <code >len</code>
        as if it had called <code >strlen(text)</code>. It is used as, e.g.,
        <code >"hello"_nVowels</code>;
    <li><code >wchar_t const *text, size_t len</code>, same as the previous one, but
        accepting a string of <code >wchar_t</code> characters. It is used as, e.g.,
        <code >L"1234"_charSum</code>;
    <li><code >char16_t const *text, size_t len</code>, same as the previous one, but
        accepting a string of <code >char16_t</code> characters. It is used as, e.g.,
        <code >u"utf 16"_uc</code>;
    <li><code >char32_t const *text, size_t len</code>, same as the previous one, but
        accepting a string of <code >char32_t</code> characters. It is used as, e.g.,
        <code >U"UTF 32"_lc</code>;
    </ul>
    If literal operators are overloaded the compiler will pick the literal
operator requiring the least `effort'. E.g., 120 is processed by a literal
operator defining an <code >unsigned long long int</code> parameter and not by its
overloaded version, defining a <code >char const *</code> parameter. But if overloaded
literal operators exist defining <code >char const *</code> and <code >long double</code>
parameters then the operator defining a <code >char const *</code> parameter is used
when the argument 120 is provided, while the operator defining a <code >long
double</code> parameter is used with the argument 120.3.
<p>
A literator operator can define any return type. Here is
an example of a definition of the <code >_NM2km</code> literal operator:
        <pre>
    double operator "" _NM2km(char const *nm)
    {
        return std::stod(nm) * 1.852;
    }

    double value = 120_NM2km;   // example of use
</pre>
    Of course, the argument could also have been a <code >long double</code>
constant. Here's an alternative implementation, explicitly expecting a <code >long
double</code>:
<p>
<pre>
    double constexpr operator "" _NM2km(long double nm)
    {
        return nm * 1.852;
    }

    double value = 450.5_NM2km;   // example of use
</pre>
<p>
A numeric constant can also be processed completely at compile-time.
Section <a href="cplusplus23.html#UDL">23.3</a> provides the details of this type of literal operator.
<p>
Arguments to literal operators are themselves always constants. A literal
operator like <code >_NM2km</code> cannot be used to convert, e.g., the value of a
variable. A literal operator, although it is defined as a function, cannot be
called like a function. The following examples therefore
result in compilation errors:
        <pre>
    double speed;

    speed_NM2km;        // no identifier 'speed_NM2km'
    _NM2km(speed);      // no function _NM2km
    _NM2km(120.3);      // no function _NM2km
</pre>

<h2 >11.13: Overloadable operators</h2>
The following <a name="an1174"></a> operators can be overloaded:
        <pre>
    +       -       *       /       %       ^       &amp;       |
    ~       !       ,       =       &lt;       &gt;       &lt;=      &gt;=
    ++      --      &lt;&lt;      &gt;&gt;      ==      !=      &amp;&amp;      ||
    +=      -=      *=      /=      %=      ^=      &amp;=      |=
    &lt;&lt;=     &gt;&gt;=     []      ()      -&gt;      -&gt;*     new     new[]
    delete  delete[]
</pre>
    Several operators have <em >textual alternatives</em>:
<p>
<div style="text-align: center">
    
        <a name="an1175"></a>
    <table style="margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;">

    <td colspan=2><hr/></td>

    </div>
<p>
`Textual' alternatives of operators are also overloadable (e.g.,
<code >operator and</code>). However, note that textual alternatives are not
<em >additional</em> operators. So, within the same context <code >operator&amp;&amp;</code> and
<code >operator and</code> can not <em >both</em> be overloaded.
<p>
Several of these operators may only be overloaded as member functions
    <a name="an1198"></a> <em >within</em> a class. This
holds true for the <code >'='</code>, the <code >'[]'</code>, the <code >'()'</code> and the <code >'-&gt;'</code>
operators. Consequently, it isn't possible to redefine, e.g., the assignment
operator globally in such a way that it accepts a <code >char const *</code> as an
<code >lvalue</code> and a <code >String &amp;</code> as an <em >rvalue</em>. Fortunately, that isn't
necessary either, as we have seen in section <a href="cplusplus11.html#ConversionOperators">11.3</a>.
<p>
Finally, the following operators cannot be  overloaded:
        <pre>
    .       .*      ::      ?:      sizeof  typeid
</pre>
