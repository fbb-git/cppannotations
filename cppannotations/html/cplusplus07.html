<h1 >Chapter 7: Classes</h1>
The <strong >C</strong> programming language offers two methods for structuring data of
different types. The <strong >C</strong> <code >struct</code> holds data members of various types, and
the <strong >C</strong> <code >union</code> also defines data members of various types. However, a
union's data members all occupy the same location in memory and the programmer
may decide on which one to use.
<p>
In this chapter classes are introduced. A <code >class</code> is a kind of <code >struct</code>,
but its contents are by default inaccessible to the outside world, whereas the
contents of a <strong >C++</strong> <code >struct</code> are by default accessible to the outside
world. In <strong >C++</strong> <code >struct</code>s find little use: they are mainly used to
aggregate data within the context of classes or to define elaborate return
values. Often a <strong >C++</strong> <code >struct</code> merely contains <em >plain old data</em> (POD,
cf. section <a href="cplusplus09.html#POD">9.9</a>). In <strong >C++</strong> the <code >class</code> is the main data structuring
device, by default enforcing two core concepts of current-day software
engineering: <em >data hiding</em> and <em >encapsulation</em> (cf. sections <a href="cplusplus03.html#HIDING">3.2.1</a>
and <a href="cplusplus07.html#APPLICATION">7.1.1</a>).
<p>
The <code >union</code> is another data structuring device the language offers. The
traditional <strong >C</strong> union is still available, but <strong >C++</strong> also offers
<em >unrestricted unions</em>. Unrestricted unions are unions whose data fields may
be of class types. The <strong >C++</strong> Annotations covers these unrestricted unions in
section <a href="cplusplus12.html#UNIONS">12.6</a>, after having introduced several other new concepts of
<strong >C++</strong>,
<p>
<strong >C++</strong> extends the <strong >C</strong> <code >struct</code> and <code >union</code> concepts by allowing the
definition of <em >member</em>
        <a name="an703"></a>
    functions (introduced in this chapter) within these data types.  Member
functions are functions that can only be used with objects of these data types
or within the scope of these data types. Some of these member functions are
special in that they are always, usually automatically, called when an object
starts its life (the so-called <em >constructor</em>) or ends its life (the
so-called <em >destructor</em>). These and other types of member functions, as well
as the design and construction of, and philosophy behind, classes are
introduced in this chapter.
<p>
We step-by-step construct a class <code >Person</code>, which could be used in a
database application to store a person's name, address and phone number.
<p>
<a name="PERSON"></a> Let's start by creating a <code >class Person</code> right away. From the
onset, it is important to make the distinction between the class
<a name="an704"></a><em >interface</em> and its <a name="an705"></a><em >implementation</em>. A class may loosely be defined as
`a set of data and all the functions operating on those data'. This definition
is later refined but for now it is sufficient to get us started.
<p>
A class interface is a definition, defining the organization of objects of
that class. Normally a definition results in memory reservation. E.g., when
defining <code >int variable</code> the compiler ensures that some memory is reserved in
the final program storing <code >variable</code>'s values.  Although it is a definition
no memory is set aside by the compiler once it has processed the class
definition. But a class definition follows the <a name="an706"></a><em >one definition rule</em>: in
<strong >C++</strong> entities may be defined only once. As a <em >class definition</em> does not
imply that memory is being reserved the term <em >class interface</em> is preferred
instead.
<p>
Class interfaces are normally contained in a class <em >header file</em>, e.g.,
<code >person.h</code>. We'll start our <code >class Person</code> interface here (cf section
<a href="cplusplus07.html#ConstFunctions">7.7</a> for an explanation of the <code >const</code> keywords behind some
of the class's member functions):
        <pre>
    #include &lt;string&gt;

    class Person
    {
        std::string d_name;         // name of person
        std::string d_address;      // address field
        std::string d_phone;        // telephone number
        size_t      d_mass;         // the mass in kg.

        public:                     // member functions
            void setName(std::string const &amp;name);
            void setAddress(std::string const &amp;address);
            void setPhone(std::string const &amp;phone);
            void setMass(size_t mass);

            std::string const &amp;name()    const;
            std::string const &amp;address() const;
            std::string const &amp;phone()   const;
            size_t mass()                const;
    };
</pre>
 The member functions that are <em >declared</em> in the interface must still be
implemented. The implementation of these members is properly called their
definition.
<p>
In addition to member <em >functions</em> classes also commonly define the <em >data</em>
that are manipulated by those member functions. These data are called the
<a name="an707"></a><em >data members</em>. In <code >Person</code> they are <code >d_name, d_address,
d_phone</code> and <code >d_mass</code>. Data members should be given private 
    <a name="an708"></a>access rights. Since the class uses private access rights by default
they are usually simply listed at the top of the class interface.
<p>
All communication between the outer world and the class data is routed through
the class's member functions. Data members may receive new values (e.g., using
<code >setName</code>) or they may be retrieved for inspection (e.g., using
<code >name</code>). Functions merely returning values stored inside the object, not
allowing the caller to modify these internally stored values, are called
 <a name="an709"></a><em >accessors</em>.
<p>
Syntactically there is only a marginal difference between a class and a
struct. Classes by default define <em >private</em> members, structs define
<em >public</em> members. Conceptually, though, there are differences.  In <strong >C++</strong>
structs are used in the way they are used in <strong >C</strong>: to aggregate data, which
are all freely accessible. Classes, on the other hand, hide their data from
access by the outside world (which is aptly called <a name="an710"></a><em >data hiding</em>)
and offer member functions to define the communication between the outer world
and the class's data members.
<p>
Following <em >Lakos</em> (Lakos, J., 2001)
    <a name="an711"></a> <strong >Large-Scale C++ Software Design</strong> (Addison-Wesley) I
suggest the following setup of class interfaces:
    <ul>
    <li> All data members have <em >private access rights</em>, and are
placed at the top of the interface.
    <li> All data members start with <code >d_</code>, followed by a name suggesting
their meaning (in chapter <a href="cplusplus08.html#StaticDataFun">8</a> we'll also
encounter data members starting with <code >s_</code>).
    <li> Non-private data members <em >do</em> exist, but one should be hesitant to
define non-private access rights for data members (see also chapter
<a href="cplusplus13.html#INHERITANCE">13</a>).
    <li> Two broad categories of member functions are
    <a name="an712"></a><em >manipulators</em> and <em >accessors</em>. Manipulators allow
the users of objects to modify the internal data of the objects. By
convention, manipulators start with <code >set</code>. E.g., <code >setName</code>.
    <li> With <em >accessors</em>, a <code >get</code>-prefix is still frequently encountered,
e.g., <code >getName</code>. However, following the conventions promoted by the <a name="an713"></a><strong >Qt</strong>
(see <a name="an714"></a><code >http://www.trolltech.com</code>)
 <a name="an715"></a><em >Graphical User Interface Toolkit</em>, the <code >get</code>-prefix is now
deprecated. So, rather than defining the member <code >getAddress</code>, it should
simply be named <code >address</code>.
    <li> Normally (exceptions exist) the public member functions of a class
are listed first, immediately following the class's data members. They are the
important elements of the interface as they define the features the class is
offering to its users. It's a matter of convention to list them high up in the
interface.  The keyword <code >private</code> is needed beyond the public members to
switch back from public members to private access rights which
nicely separates the members that may be used `by the general public' from the
class's own support members.
    </ul>
    Style conventions usually take a long time to develop. There is nothing
obligatory about them, though. I suggest that readers who have compelling
reasons <em >not</em> to follow the above style conventions use their own. All
others are strongly advised to adopt the above style conventions.
<p>
Finally, referring back to section <a href="cplusplus03.html#INTRONAME">3.1.2</a> that
        <pre>
    using namespace std;
</pre>
 must be used in most (if not all) examples of source code. As
explained in sections <a href="cplusplus07.html#CLASSHEADER">7.11</a> and <a href="cplusplus07.html#NAMESPACEHDR">7.11.1</a> the <code >using</code>
directive should follow the preprocessor directive(s) including the header
files, using a setup like the following:
        <pre>
    #include &lt;iostream&gt;
    #include "person.h"

    using namespace std;

    int main()
    {
        ...
    }
</pre>
<p>
<a name="l112"></a>
<h2 >7.1: The constructor</h2>
<strong >C++</strong> classes usually contain two special categories of member functions
which are essential to the proper working of classes. These categories are the
constructors and the <a name="an716"></a>destructor. The <em >destructor</em>'s primary task is to
return memory allocated by an object to the common pool when an object goes
`out of scope'.  Allocation of memory is discussed in chapter <a href="cplusplus09.html#MEMORY">9</a>, and
an in-depth coverage of destructors is therefore postponed until we reach that
chapter.  In the current chapter the emphasis is on the class's internal
organization and on its constructors.
<p>
Constructors are recognized by their names which are equal to their class
names.  Constructors do not specify return values, not even <code >void</code>.  E.g.,
the class <code >Person</code> may define a constructor <code >Person::Person()</code>. The
<strong >C++</strong> run-time system ensures that the constructor of a class is called when
a variable of the class is defined. It is possible to define a class lacking
any constructor. In that case the compiler defines a
 <a name="an717"></a> default constructor that is called when an object of
that class is defined. What actually happens in that case depends on the data
members that are defined by that class (cf. section <a href="cplusplus07.html#MemberInitializers">7.3.1</a>).
<p>
Objects may be defined locally or globally. However, in <strong >C++</strong> most objects
are defined locally. Globally defined objects are hardly ever required and are
somewhat deprecated.
<p>
When a function defines a local object, that object's constructor is called
every time the function is called. The object's constructor is activated at
the point where the object is defined (a subtlety is that an object may be
defined implicitly as, e.g., a temporary variable in an expression).
<p>
When an object is defined as a static object
 <a name="an718"></a><a name="an719"></a> it is constructed when
the program starts. In this case its constructor is called even
before the function <code >main</code> starts. Example:
    <pre>
    #include &lt;iostream&gt;
    using namespace std;

    class Demo
    {
        public:
            Demo();
    };

    Demo::Demo()
    {
        cout &lt;&lt; "Demo constructor called\n";
    }

    Demo d;

    int main()
    {}

    /*
        Generated output:
    Demo constructor called
    */
</pre>
 The program contains one global object of the class <code >Demo</code> with <code >main</code>
having an empty body. Nonetheless, the program produces some output generated
by the constructor of the globally defined <code >Demo</code> object.
<p>
Constructors have a very important and well-defined role. They must ensure
that all the class's data members have sensible or at least well-defined
values once the object has been constructed. We'll get back to this important
task shortly. The <em >default constructor</em><a name="an720"></a> has no
argument. It is defined by the compiler unless another constructor is defined
and unless its definition is suppressed (cf. section <a href="cplusplus07.html#DEFAULTED">7.6</a>). If a
default constructor is required in addition to another constructor then the
default constructor must explicitly be defined as well. <strong >C++</strong> provides
special syntax to realize that without much effort, which is also covered by
section <a href="cplusplus07.html#DEFAULTED">7.6</a>.
<p>
<a name="APPLICATION"></a><a name="l113"></a>
<h3 >7.1.1: A first application</h3>
    Our example class <code >Person</code> has three string data members and a <code >size_t
d_mass</code> data member. Access to these data members is controlled by
 <a name="an721"></a>interface functions.
<p>
Whenever an object is defined the class's constructor(s) ensure that its data
members are given `sensible' values. Thus, objects never suffer from
uninitialized values. Data members may be given new values, but that should
never be directly allowed. It is a core principle (called
 <a name="an722"></a><em >data hiding</em>) of good class design that its data members are private. The
modification of data members is therefore fully controlled by member functions
and thus, indirectly, by the class-designer. The class <em >encapsulates</em> all
actions performed on its data members and due to this
 <a name="an723"></a><em >encapsulation</em> the class object may assume the `responsibility' for its
own data-integrity. Here is a minimal definition of <code >Person</code>'s manipulating
members:
    <pre>
    #include "person.h"                 // given earlier
    using namespace std;

    void Person::setName(string const &amp;name)
    {
        d_name = name;
    }
    void Person::setAddress(string const &amp;address)
    {
        d_address = address;
    }
    void Person::setPhone(string const &amp;phone)
    {
        d_phone = phone;
    }
    void Person::setMass(size_t mass)
    {
        d_mass = mass;
    }
</pre>
 It's a minimal definition in that no checks are performed. But it should be
clear that checks are easy to implement. E.g., to ensure that a phone number
only contains digits one could define:
        <pre>
    void Person::setPhone(string const &amp;phone)
    {
        if (phone.find_first_not_of("0123456789") == string::npos)
            d_phone = phone;
        else if (phone.empty())
            d_phone = " - not available -";
        else
            cout &lt;&lt; "A phone number may only contain digits\n";
    }
</pre>
    Similarly, access to the data members is controlled by encapsulating
<a name="an724"></a><em >accessor</em> members. Accessors ensure that data members cannot suffer from
uncontrolled modifications. Since accessors conceptually do not modify the
object's data (but only retrieve the data) these member functions are given
the predicate <code >const</code>. They are called <a name="an725"></a><a name="an726"></a><em >const member</em>
<em >functions</em>, which, as they are guaranteed not to modify their object's
data, are available to both modifiable and constant objects (cf. section
<a href="cplusplus07.html#ConstFunctions">7.7</a>).
<p>
To prevent <a name="an727"></a><em >backdoors</em> we must also make sure that the data member is
not modifiable through an accessor's return value. For values of built-in
primitive types that's easy, as they are usually returned by value, which are
copies of the values found in variables.  But since objects may be fairly
large making copies is usually prevented by returning objects by reference. A
backdoor is created by returning a data member by reference, as in the
following example, showing the allowed abuse below the function definition:
        <pre>
    string &amp;Person::name() const
    {
        return d_name;
    }

    Person somebody;
    somebody.setName("Nemo");

    somebody.name() = "Eve";    // Oops, backdoor changing the name
</pre>
    To prevent the backdoor objects are returned as <em >const references</em> from
accessors. Here are the implementations of <code >Person</code>'s accessors:
    <pre>
    #include "person.h"                 // given earlier
    using namespace std;

    string const &amp;Person::name() const
    {
        return d_name;
    }
    string const &amp;Person::address() const
    {
       return d_address;
    }
    string const &amp;Person::phone() const
    {
       return d_phone;
    }
    size_t Person::mass() const
    {
       return d_mass;
    }
</pre>
<p>
The <code >Person</code> class interface remains the starting point for the class
design: its member functions define what can be asked of a <code >Person</code>
object. In the end the implementation of its members merely is a technicality
allowing <code >Person</code> objects to do their jobs.
<p>
The next example shows how the class <code >Person</code> may be used. An object is
initialized and passed to a function <code >printperson()</code>, printing the person's
data. Note the reference operator in the parameter list of the function
<code >printperson</code>.  Only a reference to an existing <code >Person</code> object is passed
to the function, rather than a complete object.  The fact that
<code >printperson</code> does not modify its argument is evident from the fact that
the parameter is declared <code >const</code>.
    <pre>
    #include &lt;iostream&gt;
    #include "person.h"                 // given earlier
    using namespace std;

    void printperson(Person const &amp;p)
    {
        cout &lt;&lt; "Name    : " &lt;&lt; p.name()     &lt;&lt; "\n"
                "Address : " &lt;&lt; p.address()  &lt;&lt; "\n"
                "Phone   : " &lt;&lt; p.phone()    &lt;&lt; "\n"
                "Mass  : " &lt;&lt; p.mass()   &lt;&lt; '\n';
    }

    int main()
    {
        Person p;

        p.setName("Linus Torvalds");
        p.setAddress("E-mail: Torvalds@cs.helsinki.fi");
        p.setPhone("");
        p.setMass(75);           // kg.

        printperson(p);
    }
/*
    Produced output:

Name    : Linus Torvalds
Address : E-mail: Torvalds@cs.helsinki.fi
Phone   :  - not available -
Mass  : 75

*/
</pre>
<p>
<a name="l114"></a>
<h3 >7.1.2: Constructors: with and  without arguments</h3>
    The class <code >Person</code>'s constructor so far has not received any
parameters. <strong >C++</strong> allows constructors to be defined with or without
parameter lists. The arguments are supplied when an object is defined.
<p>
For the class <code >Person</code> a constructor expecting three strings and a
<code >size_t</code> might be useful. Representing, respectively, the person's name,
address, phone number and mass. This constructor can be implemented like this
(but see also section <a href="cplusplus07.html#MemberInitializers">7.3.1</a>):
        <pre>
    Person::Person(string const &amp;name, string const &amp;address,
                   string const &amp;phone, size_t mass)
    {
        d_name = name;
        d_address = address;
        setPhone(phone);
        d_mass = mass;
    }
</pre>
    It must of course also be declared in the class interface:
        <pre>
    class Person
    {
        // data members (not altered)

        public:
            Person(std::string const &amp;name, std::string const &amp;address,
                   std::string const &amp;phone, size_t mass);

            // rest of the class interface (not altered)
    };
</pre>
    Now that this constructor has been declared, the default constructor must
explicitly be declared as well if we still want to be able to construct a
plain <code >Person</code> object without any specific initial values for its data
members.  The class <code >Person</code> would thus support two constructors, and the
part declaring the constructors now becomes:
        <pre>
    class Person
    {
        // data members
        public:
            Person();
            Person(std::string const &amp;name, std::string const &amp;address,
                   std::string const &amp;phone, size_t mass);

            // additional members
    };
</pre>
 In this case, the default constructor doesn't have to do very much, as it
doesn't have to initialize the <code >string</code> data members of the <code >Person</code>
object. As these data members are objects themselves, they are initialized to
empty strings by their own default constructor.  However, there is also a
<code >size_t</code> data member. That member is a variable of a built-in type and such
variabes do not have constructors and so are not initialized automatically.
Therefore, unless the value of the <code >d_mass</code> data member is explicitly
initialized its value is:
    <ul>
    <li> a <em >random</em> value for local <code >Person</code> objects;
    <li> 0 for global and static <code >Person</code> objects.
    </ul>
    The 0-value might not be too bad, but normally we don't want a <em >random</em>
value for our data members. So, even the default constructor has a job to do:
initializing the data members which are not initialized to sensible values
automatically. Its implementation can be:
        <pre>
    Person::Person()
    {
        d_mass = 0;
    }
</pre>
    Using constructors with and without arguments is illustrated next. The
object <code >karel</code> is initialized by the constructor defining a non-empty
parameter list while the default constructor is used for the <code >anon</code>
object. When constructing objects using constructors requiring arguments you
are advised to surround the arguments by curly braces. Parentheses can often
also be used, and sometimes even <em >have</em> to be used (cf. section
<a href="cplusplus12.html#VECTOR">12.4.2</a>), but mindlessly using parentheses instead of curly braces may
easily result in unexpected problems (cf. section <a href="cplusplus07.html#AMBIGUITY">7.2</a>). Hence the
advice to prefer curly braces rather than parentheses. Here's the
example showing two constructor-calls:
        <pre>
    int main()
    {
        Person karel{ "Karel", "Rietveldlaan 37", "542 6044", 70 };
        Person anon;
    }
</pre>
    The two <code >Person</code> objects are defined when <code >main</code> starts as they are
<em >local</em> objects, living only for as long as <code >main</code> is active.
<p>
If <code >Person</code> objects must be definable using other arguments,
corresponding constructors must be added to <code >Person</code>'s interface. Apart from
overloading class constructors it is also possible to provide constructors
with default argument values. These default arguments must be specified with
the constructor declarations in the class interface, like so:
        <pre>
    class Person
    {
        public:
            Person(std::string const &amp;name,
                   std::string const &amp;address = "--unknown--",
                   std::string const &amp;phone   = "--unknown--",
                   size_t mass = 0);

    };
</pre>
    Often, constructors use highly similar  implementions. This results
from the fact that the constructor's parameters are often defined for
convenience: a constructor not requiring a <code >phone</code> number but requiring a
<code >mass</code> cannot be defined using default arguments, since <code >phone</code> is not
the constructor's last parameter. Consequently a special constructor is
required not having <code >phone</code> in its parameter list.
<p>
Before the C++11 standard this situation was commonly handled like this:
all constructors <em >must</em> initialize their reference and <code >const</code> data
members, or the compiler (rightfully) complains. To initialize the remaining
members (non-const and non-reference members) we have two options:
    <ul>
    <li> If the body of the construction process is sizeable but
(parameterizable) identical to other constructors bodies then
factorize. Define a private member <code >init</code> which is called by the
constructors to provide the object's data members with their appropriate
values.
    <li> If the constructors act fundamentally differently, then there's
nothing to factorize and each constructor must be implemented by itself.
    </ul>
    Currently, <strong >C++</strong> allows constructors to call each other (called
 <em >constructor delegation</em>). This is illustrated in section <a href="cplusplus07.html#CONSCALL">7.4.1</a>
below.
<p>
<a name="l115"></a>
<h4>7.1.2.1: The order of construction</h4>
        The possibility to pass arguments to constructors allows us to monitor the
construction order of objects during program execution.  This is illustrated
by the next program using a class <code >Test</code>. The program defines a global
<code >Test</code> object and two local <code >Test</code> objects. The order of construction is
as expected: first global, then main's first local object, then <code >func</code>'s
local object, and then, finally, <code >main</code>'s second local object:
    <pre>
    #include &lt;iostream&gt;
    #include &lt;string&gt;
    using namespace std;

    class Test
    {
        public:
            Test(string const &amp;name);   // constructor with an argument
    };

    Test::Test(string const &amp;name)
    {
        cout &lt;&lt; "Test object " &lt;&lt; name &lt;&lt; " created" &lt;&lt; '\n';
    }

    Test globaltest("global");

    void func()
    {
        Test functest("func");
    }

    int main()
    {
        Test first{ "main first" };
        func();
        Test second{ "main second" };
    }
/*
    Generated output:
Test object global created
Test object main first created
Test object func created
Test object main second created
*/
</pre>
<p>
<a name="AMBIGUITY"></a><a name="l116"></a>
<h2 >7.2: Ambiguity resolution</h2>
Calling constructors using parentheses may result in unexpected
surprises. Assume the following class interface is available:
        <pre>
    class Data
    {
        public:
            Data();
            Data(int one);
            Data(int one, int two);

            void display();
    };
</pre>
<p>
The intention is to define two objects of the class Data, using, respectively,
the first and second constructors, while using parentheses in the object
definitions. Your code looks like this (and compiles correctly):
        <pre>
    #include "data.h"
    int main()
    {
        Data d1();
        Data d2(argc);
    }
</pre>
<p>
Now it's time to make some good use of the <code >Data</code> objects. Let's add two
statements to <code >main</code>:
            <pre>
        d1.display();
        d2.display();
</pre>
    But, surprise, the compiler complains about the first of these two:
<p>
<em >error: request for member 'display' in 'd1', which is of non-class type
'Data()'</em>
<p>
What's going on here? First of all, notice the data type the compiler refers
to: <code >Data()</code>, rather than <code >Data</code>. What are those <code >()</code> doing there?
<p>
Before answering that question, let's broaden our story somewhat. We know that
somewhere in a library a <a name="an728"></a><em >factory function</em> <code >dataFactory</code> exists. A
factory function creates and returns an object of a certain type. This
<code >dataFactory</code> function returns a <code >Data</code> object, constructed using
<code >Data</code>'s default constructor. Hence, <code >dataFactory</code> needs no arguments. We
want to use <code >dataFactory</code> in our program, but must declare the function. So
we add the declaration to <code >main</code>, as that's the only location where
<code >dataFactory</code> will be used. It's a function, not requiring arguments,
returning a <code >Data</code> object:
            <pre>
        Data dataFactory();
</pre>
    This, however, looks remarkably similar to our <code >d1</code> object definition:
            <pre>
        Data d1();
</pre>
<p>
We found the source of our problem: <code >Data d1()</code> apparently is <em >not</em>
the definition of a <code >d1</code> object, but the <em >declaration</em> of a function,
returning a <code >Data</code> object. So, what's happening here and how should we 
define a <code >Data</code> object using <code >Data</code>'s default constructor?
<p>
First: what's happening here is that the compiler, when confronted with
<code >Data d1()</code>, actually had a choice. It could either define a <code >Data</code>
object, or declare a function. It declares a function. 
<p>
In fact, we're encountering an <a name="an729"></a>ambiguity in <strong >C++</strong>'s grammar here, which is
solved, according to the language's standard, by always letting a declaration
prevail over a definition. We'll encounter more situations where this
ambiguity occurs later on in this section.
<p>
Second: there are several ways we can solve this ambiguity the way we
want it to be solved. To define an object using its default constructor:
    <ul>
    <li> merely mention it (like <code >int x</code>): <code >Data d1</code>;
    <li> use the curly-brace initialization: <code >Data d1{}</code>;
    <li> use the assignment operator and an anonymous default constructed
        <code >Data</code> object: <code >Data d1 = Data{}</code>, or possibly <code >Data d1 =
        Data()</code>. 
    </ul>
<p>
<a name="l117"></a>
<h3 >7.2.1: Types `Data' vs. `Data()'</h3>
    
    <code >Data()</code> in the above context defines a default constructed anonymous
<code >Data</code> object. This takes us back to the compiler error. According to the
compiler, our original <code >d1</code> apparently was not of type <code >Data</code>, but of type
<code >Data()</code>. So what's that?
<p>
Let's first have a look at our second constructor. It expects an
<code >int</code>. We would like to define another <code >Data</code> object, using the second
constructor, but want to pass the default <code >int</code> value to the constructor,
using <code >int()</code>. We know this defines a default <code >int</code> value, as <code >cout &lt;&lt;
int() &lt;&lt; '\n'</code> nicely displays 0, and <code >int x = int()</code> also initialized x to 
0. So we define <code >`Data di(int())'</code> in <code >main</code>.
<p>
Not good: again the compiler complains when we try to use
<code >di</code>. After <code >`di.display()'</code> the compiler tells us:
<p>
<em >error: request for member 'display' in 'di', which is of non-class type
'Data(int (*)())'</em> 
<p>
Oops, again not as expected.... Didn't we pass 0? Why the sudden pointer? It's
that same `use a declaration when possible' strategy again. The notation
<code >Type()</code> not only represents the default value of type <code >Type</code>, but it's
also a shorthand notation for an anonymous pointer to a function, not
expecting arguments, and returning a <code >Type</code> value, which you can verify by
defining <code >`int (*ip)() = nullptr'</code>, and passing <code >ip</code> as argument to
<code >di</code>: <code >di(ip)</code> compiles fine.
<p>
So why doesn't the error occur when inserting <code >int()</code> or assigning <code >int()</code>
to <code >int x</code>? In these latter cases nothing is declared. Rather, `<code >cout</code>'
and `<code >int x =</code>' require expressions determining values, which is provided by
<code >int()</code>'s `natural' interpretation. But with <code >`Data di(int())'</code> the
compiler again has a choice, and (by design) it chooses a declaration because
the declaration takes priority. Now <code >int()</code>'s interpretation as an anonymous
pointer is available and therefore used.
<p>
Likewise, if <code >int x</code> has been defined, <code >`Data b1(int(x))'</code> declares <code >b1</code>
as a function, expecting an <code >int</code> (as <code >int(x)</code> represents a type), while
<code >`Data b2((int)x)'</code> defines <code >b2</code> as a <code >Data</code> object, using the
constructor expecting a single <code >int</code> value.
<p>
Again, to use default entities, values or objects, prefer <code >{}</code> over <code >()</code>:
<code >Data di{ int{} }</code> defines <code >di</code> of type <code >Data</code>, calling the <code >Data(int
x)</code> constructor and uses <code >int's</code> default value 0.
<p>
<a name="l118"></a>
<h3 >7.2.2: Superfluous parentheses</h3>
    Let's play some more. At some point in our program we defined <code >int b</code>. Then,
in a compound statement we need to construct an anonymous <code >Data</code> object,
initialized using <code >b</code>, followed by displaying <code >b</code>:
    
            <pre>
    int b = 18;
    {
        Data(b);
        cout &lt;&lt; b;
    }
</pre>
    About that <code >cout</code> statement the compiler tells us (I modified the
error message to reveal its meaning):
<p>
<em >error: cannot bind `std::ostream &amp; &lt;&lt; Data const &amp;'</em>
<p>
Here we didn't insert <code >int b</code> but <code >Data b</code>. Had we omitted the compound
statement, the compiler would have complained about a doubly defined <code >b</code>
entity, as <code >Data(b)</code> simply means <code >Data b</code>, a <code >Data</code> object constructed
by default. The compiler may omit superfluous parentheses when parsing a
definition or declaration. 
<p>
Of course, the question now becomes how a temporary object <code >Data</code>,
initialized with <code >int b</code> can be defined. Remember that the compiler may
remove superfluous parentheses. So, what we need to do is to pass an <code >int</code>
to the anonymous <code >Data</code> object, without using the <code >int</code>'s name.
    <ul>
    <li> We can use a cast: <code >Data(static_cast&lt;int&gt;(b))</code>;
    <li> We can use a curly-brace initialization: <code >Data{ b }</code>.
    </ul>
<p>
Values and types make big differences. Consider the following definitions:
        <pre>
    Data (*d4)(int);    // 1
    Data (*d5)(3);      // 2
</pre>
    Definition 1 should cause no problems: it's a pointer to a function,
expecting an <code >int</code>, returning a <code >Data</code> object. Hence, <code >d4</code> is a pointer
variable.  
<p>
Definition 2 is slightly more complex. Yes, it's a pointer. But it has
nothing to do with a function. So what's that argument list containing 3 doing
there? Well, it's not an argument list. It's an initialization that looks like
an argument list. Remember that variables can be initialized using the
assignment statement, by parentheses or by curly parentheses. So instead of
<code >`(3)'</code> we could have written <code >`= 3'</code> or <code >`{3}'</code>. Let's pick the first
alternative, resulting in:
        <pre>
    Data (*d5) = 3;
</pre>
    Now we get to `play compiler' again. Removing some superfluous
parentheses we get:
        <pre>
    Data *d5 = 3;
</pre>
    It's a pointer to a <code >Data</code> object, initialized to 3. This is
semantically incorrect, but that's only clear after the syntactical
analysis. If I had initially written
        <pre>
     Data (*d5)(&amp;d1);      // 2
</pre>
    the fun resulting from contrasting <code >int</code> and <code >3</code> would most likely
have been spoiled.
<p>
<a name="l119"></a>
<h3 >7.2.3: Existing types</h3>
    Once a type name has been defined it also prevails over identifiers
representing variables, if the compiler is given a choice. This, too, can
result in interesting constructions.
<p>
Assume a function <code >process</code> expecting an <code >int</code> exists in a library. We
want to use this function to process some <code >int</code> data values. So in <code >main</code>
<code >process</code> is declared and called:
        <pre>
    int process(int Data);
    process(argc);
</pre>
    No problems here. But unfortunately we once decided to `beautify' our
code, by throwing in some superfluous parentheses, like so:
        <pre>
    int process(int (Data));
    process(argc);
</pre>
    Now we're in trouble. The compiler now generates an error, caused by its
rule to let declarations prevail over definitions. <code >Data</code> now becomes the
name of the <code >class Data</code>, and analogous to <code >int (x)</code> the parameter <code >int
(Data)</code> is parsed as <code >int (*)(Data)</code>: a pointer to a function, expecting a
<code >Data</code> object, returning an <code >int</code>. 
<p>
Here is another example. When, instead of declaring 
        <pre>
    int process(int Data[10]);
</pre>
we declare, e.g., to emphasize the fact that an array is passed to
<code >process</code>:
        <pre>
    int process(int (Data[10]));
</pre>
    the <code >process</code> function does not expect a pointer to <code >int</code> values, but
a pointer to a function expecting a pointer to <code >Data</code> elements, returning an
<code >int</code>. 
<p>
To summarize the findings in the `Ambiguity Resolution' section:
    <ul>
    <li> The compiler will try to remove superfluous parentheses;
    <li> But if the parenthesized construction represents a type, it will try
        to use the type;
    <li> More in general: when possible the compiler will interpret a
        syntactic construction as a declaration, rather than as a definition
        (of an object or variable).
    <li> Most problems that result from the compiler interpreting
        constructions as declarations are caused by us using parentheses. As a
        <a name="an730"></a>rule of thumb: use curly braces, rather than parentheses when
        constructing objects (or values).
    </ul>
<p>
<a name="Composition"></a><a name="l120"></a>
<h2 >7.3: Objects inside objects: composition</h2>
In the class <code >Person</code> objects are used as data members. This construction
technique is called <a name="an731"></a><em >composition</em>.
<p>
Composition is neither extraordinary nor <strong >C++</strong> specific: in <strong >C</strong>
a <code >struct</code> or <code >union</code> field is commonly used in other compound types. In
<strong >C++</strong> it requires some special thought as their initialization sometimes is
subject to restrictions, as discussed in the next few sections.
<p>
<a name="MemberInitializers"></a><a name="l121"></a>
<h3 >7.3.1: Composition and const objects: const member initializers</h3>
    Unless specified otherwise object data members of classes are initialized by
their default constructors. Using the default constructor might not always be
the optimal way to intialize an object and it might not even be possible: a
class might simply not define a default constructor.
<p>
Earlier we've encountered the following constructor of the <code >Person</code>:
        <pre>
    Person::Person(string const &amp;name, string const &amp;address,
                   string const &amp;phone, size_t mass)
    {
        d_name = name;
        d_address = address;
        d_phone = phone;
        d_mass = mass;
    }
</pre>
 Think briefly about what is going on in this constructor. In the
constructor's body we encounter assignments to string objects. Since
assignments are used in the constructor's body their left-hand side objects
must exist. But when objects are coming into existence constructors <em >must</em>
have been called. The initialization of those objects is thereupon immediately
undone by the body of <code >Person</code>'s constructor. That is
not only inefficient but sometimes downright impossible. Assume that the class
interface mentions a <code >string const</code> data member: a data member whose value
is not supposed to change at all (like a birthday, which usually  doesn't
change very much and is therefore a good candidate for a <code >string const</code> data
member). Constructing a birthday object and providing it with an initial value
is OK, but changing the initial value isn't.
<p>
The body of a constructor allows assignments to data members. The
<em >initialization</em> of data members happens before that. <strong >C++</strong> defines the
 <a name="an732"></a><em >member initializer</em> syntax allowing us to specify the way data members
are initialized at construction time. Member initializers are specified as a
list of constructor specifications between  a colon following a constructor's
parameter list and the opening curly brace of a constructor's body, as
follows:
        <pre>
    Person::Person(string const &amp;name, string const &amp;address,
                   string const &amp;phone, size_t mass)
    :
        d_name(name),
        d_address(address),
        d_phone(phone),
        d_mass(mass)
    {}
</pre>
 Member initialization <em >always</em> occurs when objects are composed in
classes: if <em >no</em> constructors are mentioned in the member initializer list
the default constructors of the objects are called. Note that this only holds
true for <em >objects</em>. Data members of primitive data types are <em >not</em>
initialized automatically.
<p>
Member initialization can, however, also be used for primitive data members,
like <code >int</code> and <code >double</code>. The above example shows the initialization of the
data member <code >d_mass</code> from the parameter <code >mass</code>. When member
initializers are used the data member could even have the same name as the
constructor's parameter (although this is deprecated) as there is no ambiguity
and the first (left) identifier used in a member initializer is always a data
member that is initialized whereas the identifier between parentheses is
interpreted as the parameter.
<p>
The <em >order</em> in which class type data members are initialized is defined by
the order in which those members are defined in the composing class
interface. If the order of the initialization in the constructor differs from
the order in the class interface, the compiler complains, and reorders the
initialization so as to match the order of the class interface.
<p>
Member initializers should be used as often as possible. As shown it may be
required to use them (e.g., to initialize const data members, or to initialize
objects of classes lacking default constructors) but <em >not</em> using member
initializers also results in inefficient code as the default constructor of a
data member is always automatically called unless an explicit member
initializer is specified. Reassignment in the constructor's body following
default construction is then clearly inefficient. Of course, sometimes it is
fine to use the default constructor, but in those cases the explicit member
initializer can be omitted.
<p>
As a <a name="an733"></a>rule of thumb: if a value is assigned to a data member in the
constructor's body then try to avoid that assignment in favor of using a
member initializer.
<p>
<a name="REFMEMBERS"></a><a name="l122"></a>
<h3 >7.3.2: Composition and reference objects: reference member initializers</h3>
    Apart from using member initializers to initialize composed objects (be they
<code >const</code> objects or not), there is another situation where member
initializers must be used. Consider the following situation.
<p>
A program uses an object of the class <code >Configfile</code>, defined in <code >main</code>
to access the information in a configuration file. The configuration file
contains parameters of the program which may be set by changing the values in
the configuration file, rather than by supplying command line arguments.
<p>
Assume another object used in <code >main</code> is an object of the class <code >Process</code>,
doing `all the work'. What possibilities do we have to tell the object of the
class <code >Process</code> that an object of the class <code >Configfile</code> exists?
    <ul>
    <li> The objects could have been declared as <em >global</em> objects. This
<em >is</em> a possibility, but not a very good one, since all the advantages of
local objects are lost.
    <li> The <code >Configfile</code> object may be passed to the <code >Process</code> object at
construction time. Bluntly passing an object (i.e., by value) might not
be a very good idea, since the object must be copied into the <code >Configfile</code>
parameter, and then a data member of the <code >Process</code> class can be used to make
the <code >Configfile</code> object accessible throughout the <code >Process</code> class. This
might involve yet another object-copying task, as in the following situation:
    <pre>
Process::Process(Configfile conf)   // a copy from the caller
{
    d_conf = conf;                  // copying to d_conf member
}
</pre>
    <li> The copy-instructions can be avoided if <em >pointers</em> to
the <code >Configfile</code> objects are used, as in:
    <pre>
Process::Process(Configfile *conf)  // pointer to external object
{
    d_conf = conf;                  // d_conf is a Configfile *
}
</pre>
    This construction as such is OK, but forces us to use the `<code >-&gt;</code>' field
selector operator, rather than the `<code >.</code>' operator, which is (disputably)
awkward. Conceptually one tends to think of the <code >Configfile</code> object as an
object, and not as a pointer to an object. In <strong >C</strong> this would probably have
been the preferred method, but in <strong >C++</strong> we can do better.
    <li> Rather than using value or pointer parameters, the <code >Configfile</code>
parameter could be defined as a <a name="an734"></a><em >reference parameter</em> of <code >Process</code>'s
constructor. Next, use a <code >Config</code> reference data member in the
<code >class Process</code>.
    </ul>
    But a reference variable cannot be initialized using an assignment, and so
the following is incorrect:
        <pre>
    Process::Process(Configfile &amp;conf)
    {
        d_conf = conf;        // wrong: no assignment
    }
</pre>
    The statement <code >d_conf = conf</code> fails, because it is not an
initialization, but an assignment of one <code >Configfile</code> object (i.e.,
<code >conf</code>), to another (<code >d_conf</code>). An assignment to a reference variable is
actually an assignment to the variable the reference variable refers to. But
which variable does <code >d_conf</code> refer to? To no variable at all, since we
haven't initialized <code >d_conf</code>.  After all, the whole purpose of the statement
<code >d_conf = conf</code> was to initialize <code >d_conf</code>....
<p>
How to initialize <code >d_conf</code>? We once again use the member initializer
syntax. Here is the correct way to  initialize <code >d_conf</code>:
        <pre>
    Process::Process(Configfile &amp;conf)
    :
        d_conf(conf)      // initializing reference member
    {}
</pre>
    The above syntax must be used in all cases where reference data members
are used. E.g., if <code >d_ir</code> would have been an <code >int</code> reference data member,
a construction like
        <pre>
    Process::Process(int &amp;ir)
    :
        d_ir(ir)
    {}
</pre>
    would have been required.
<p>
<a name="l123"></a>
<h2 >7.4: Data member initializers</h2>
    Non-static data members of classes are usually initialized by the class's
constructors. Frequently (but not always) the same initializations are used by
different constructors, resulting in multiple points where the initializations
are performed, which in turn complicates class maintenance.
<p>
Consider a class defining several data members: a pointer to data, a data
member storing the number of data elements the pointer points at, a data
member storing the sequence number of the object. The class also
offer a basic set of constructors, as shown in the following class interface:
        <pre>
    class Container
    {
        Data *d_data;
        size_t d_size;
        size_t d_nr;

        static size_t s_nObjects;

        public:
            Container();
            Container(Container const &amp;other);
            Container(Data *data, size_t size);
            Container(Container &amp;&amp;tmp);
    };
</pre>
    The initial values of the data members are easy to describe, but somewhat
hard to implement. Consider the initial situation and assume the default
constructor is used: all data members should be set to 0, except for <code >d_nr</code>
which must be given the value <code >++s_nObjects</code>. Since these are
<em >non</em>-default actions, we can't declare the default constructor using <code >=
default</code>, but we must provide an actual implementation:
            <pre>
    Container()
    :
        d_data(0),
        d_size(0),
        d_nr(++s_nObjects)
    {}
</pre>
    In fact, <em >all</em> constructors require us to state the
<code >d_nr(++s_nObjects)</code> initialization. So if <code >d_data</code>'s type would have been
a (move aware) class type, we would still have to provide implementations for
all of the above constructors.
<p>
<strong >C++</strong>, however, also supports <a name="an735"></a><em >data member initializers</em>,
simplifying the initialization of non-static data members. Data member
initializers allow us to assign initial values to data members. The compiler
must be able to compute these initial values from initialization expressions,
but the initial values do not have to be constant expressions. So
<code >++s_nObjects</code> can be an initial value.
<p>
Using data member initializers for the class <code >Container</code> we get:
        <pre>
    class Container
    {
        Data *d_data = 0;
        size_t d_size = 0;
        size_t d_nr = ++nObjects;

        static size_t s_nObjects;

        public:
            Container() = default;
            Container(Container const &amp;other);
            Container(Data *data, size_t size);
            Container(Container &amp;&amp;tmp);
    };
</pre>
    Note that the data member initializations are recognized by the compiler,
and are applied to its implementation of the default constructor. In fact, all
constructors will apply the data member initializations, unless explicitly
initialized otherwise. E.g., the move-constructor may now be implemented like
this:
        <pre>
    Container(Container &amp;&amp;tmp)
    :
        d_data(tmp.d_data),
        d_size(tmp.d_size)
    {
        tmp.d_data = 0;
    }
</pre>
    Although <code >d_nr</code>'s intialization is left out of the implementation it
<em >is</em> initialized due to the data member initialization provided in the
class's interface.
<p>
An <a name="an736"></a><em >aggregate</em> is an array or a <code >class</code> (usually a <code >struct</code> with no
user-defined constructors, no private or protected non-static data members,
no base classes (cf. chapter <a href="cplusplus13.html#INHERITANCE">13</a>), and no virtual functions
(cf. chapter <a href="cplusplus14.html#POLYMORPHISM">14</a>)). E.g.,
        <pre>
    struct POD      // defining aggregate POD
    {
        int first = 5; 
        double second = 1.28; 
        std::string hello{ "hello" };
    };
</pre>
<p>
To initialize such aggregates <em >braced initializer lists</em> can be used. In
fact, their use is preferred over using the older form (using parentheses), as
using braces avoids confusion with function declarations. E.g.,
        <pre>
    POD pod{ 4, 13.5, "hi there" };
</pre>
    When using  braced-initializer lists not all data members need to be
initialized. Specification may stop at any data member, in which case the
default (or explicitly defined initialization values) of the remaining data
members are used. E.g.,
        <pre>
    POD pod{ 4 };   // uses second: 1.28, hello: "hello"
</pre>

<h3 >7.4.1: Delegating constructors</h3>
    Often constructors are specializations of each other, allowing objects to be
constructed specifying only subsets of arguments for all of its data members,
using default argument values for the remaining data members.
<p>
Before the C++11 standard common practice was to define a member like <code >init</code>
performing all initializations common to constructors. Such an <code >init</code>
function, however, cannot be used to initialize <code >const</code> or reference data
members, nor can it be used to perform so-called <em >base class</em>
initializations (cf. chapter <a href="cplusplus13.html#INHERITANCE">13</a>).
<p>
Here is an example where such an <code >init</code> function might have been used. A
class <code >Stat</code> is designed as a wrapper class around <strong >C</strong>'s <a name="an737"></a><strong >stat</strong>(2)
function. The class might define three constructors: one expecting no
arguments and initializing all data members to appropriate values; a second
one doing the same, but it calls <code >stat</code> for the filename provided to the
constructor; and a third one expecting a filename and a search path for the
provided file name. Instead of repeating the initialization code in each
constructor, the common code can be factorized into a member <code >init</code> which
is called by the constructors.
<p>
<strong >C++</strong> offers an alternative by allowing constructors to call each
other. This is called
    <a name="an738"></a>
    <a name="an739"></a><em >delegating constructors</em>
        which is illustrated by the next example:
        <pre>
    class Stat
    {
        public:
            Stat()
            :
                Stat("", "")        // no filename/searchpath
            {}
            Stat(std::string const &amp;fileName)
            :
                Stat(fileName, "")  // only a filename
            {}
            Stat(std::string const &amp;fileName, std::string const &amp;searchPath)
            :
                d_filename(fileName),
                d_searchPath(searchPath)
            {
                // remaining actions to be performed by the constructor
            }
    };
</pre>
<p>
<strong >C++</strong> allows static const integral data members to be initialized within
the <a name="an740"></a> class interfaces (cf. chapter
<a href="cplusplus08.html#StaticDataFun">8</a>). The <a name="an741"></a>C++11 standard adds to this the facility to define
default initializations for plain data members in class interfaces (these data
members may or may not be <code >const</code> or of integral types, but (of course) they
cannot be reference data members).
<p>
These default initializations may be overruled by constructors. E.g., if
the class <code >Stat</code> uses a data member <code >bool d_hasPath</code> which is <code >false</code> by
default but the third constructor (see above) should initialize it to <code >true</code>
then the following approach is possible:
        <pre>
    class Stat
    {
        bool d_hasPath = false;

        public:
            Stat(std::string const &amp;fileName, std::string const &amp;searchPath)
            :
                d_hasPath(true)     // overrule the interface-specified
            {}                      // value
    };
</pre>
    Here <code >d_hasPath</code> receives its value only once: it's always initialized
to <code >false</code> except when the shown constructor is used in which case it is
initialized to <code >true</code>.
<p>
<a name="UNIFORMINIT"></a><a name="l125"></a>
<h2 >7.5: Uniform initialization</h2>
When defining variables and objects they may immediately be given
initial values. Class type objects are always initialized using one of their
available constructors. <strong >C</strong> already supports the array and struct
 <a name="an742"></a><a name="an743"></a><em >initializer list</em> consisting of a list of constant
expressions surrounded by a pair of curly braces.
<p>
<strong >C++</strong> supports a comparable initialization, called 
    <a name="an744"></a><em >uniform initialization</em>. It uses the following syntax:
        <pre>
    Type object{ value list };
</pre>
    When defining objects using a list of objects each individual object
may use its own uniform initialization.
<p>
The advantage of uniform initialization over using constructors is that using
constructor arguments may sometimes result in an ambiguity as constructing an
object may sometimes be confused with using the object's overloaded function
call operator (cf. section <a href="cplusplus11.html#FUNOBJ">11.10</a>). As initializer lists can only be used
with <em >plain old data</em> (POD) types (cf. section <a href="cplusplus09.html#POD">9.9</a>) and with classes
that are `initializer list aware' (like <code >std::vector</code>) the ambiguity does
not arise when initializer lists are used.
<p>
Uniform initialization can be used to initialize an object or
variable, but also to initialize data members in a constructor or implicitly
in the return statement of functions. Examples:
        <pre>
    class Person
    {
        // data members
        public:
            Person(std::string const &amp;name, size_t mass)
            :
                d_name {name},
                d_mass {mass}
            {}

            Person copy() const
            {
                return {d_name, d_mass};
            }
    };
</pre>
<p>
Object definitions may be encountered in unexpected places, easily resulting in
(human) confusion. Consider a function `<code >func</code>' and a very simple
class <code >Fun</code> (<code >struct</code> is used, as data hiding is not an issue here;
in-class implementations are used for brevity):
        <pre>
    void func();

    struct Fun
    {
        Fun(void (*f)())
        {
            std::cout &lt;&lt; "Constructor\n";
        };

        void process()
        {
            std::cout &lt;&lt; "process\n";
        }
    };
</pre>
    In <code >main</code> a <code >Fun</code> object is defined: <code >Fun fun(func)</code>. Running this
program displays <code >Constructor</code>: <code >fun</code> is constructed. Next we intend to
call <code >process</code> for an anonymous <code >Fun</code> object:
        <pre>
    Fun fun(func);
    Fun(func).process();
</pre>
    <code >Constructor</code> appears twice, and then <code >process</code> is
displayed.
<p>
What about just defining an anonymous <code >Fun</code> object? We do:
        <pre>
    Fun(func);
</pre>
    Now we're in for a surprise. The compiler complains that <code >Fun</code>'s default
constructor is missing. Why's that? Insert some blanks immediately after
<code >Fun</code> and you get <code >Fun (func)</code>. Parentheses around an identifier are OK,
and are stripped off once the parenthesized expression has been parsed. In
this case: <code >(func)</code> equals <code >func</code>, and so we have <code >Fun func</code>: the
definition of a <code >Fun func</code> object, using <code >Fun</code>'s default constructor (which
isn't provided).
<p>
So why does <code >Fun(func).process()</code> compile? In this case we have a member
selector operator, whose left-hand operand must be an class-type object. The
object must exist, and <code >Fun(func)</code> represents that object. It's not the name
of an existing object, but a constructor expecting a function like <code >func</code>
exists. The compiler now creates an anonymous <code >Fun</code>, passing it <code >func</code> as
its argument.
<p>
Clearly, in this example, parentheses cannot be used to create an anonymous
<code >Fun</code> object. However, the uniform initialization <em >can</em> be used. To define
the anonymous <code >Fun</code> object use this syntax:
        <pre>
    Fun{ func };
</pre>
    (which can also be used to immediately call one of its members. E.g.,
<code >Fun{func}.process()</code>).
<p>
Although the uniform intialization syntax is slightly different from the
syntax  of an initializer list (the latter using the assignment operator) the
compiler nevertheless uses the initializer list if a constructor
supporting an initializer list is available. As an example consider:
        <pre>
    class Vector
    {
        public:
            Vector(size_t size);
            Vector(std::initializer_list&lt;int&gt; const &amp;values);
    };

    Vector vi = {4};
</pre>
    When defining <code >vi</code> the constructor expecting the initializer list is
called rather than the constructor expecting a <code >size_t</code> argument. If the
latter constructor is required the definition using the standard constructor
syntax must be used. I.e., <code >Vector vi(4)</code>.
<p>
Initializer lists are themselves objects that may be constructed using
another initializer list. However, values stored in an initializer list are
immutable. Once the initializer list has been defined their values remain
as-is.
<p>
Before using initializer lists the
    <code >initializer_list</code><a name="an745"></a> header file must be included.
<p>
Initializer lists support a basic set of member functions and constructors:
    <ul>
    <li><a name="an746"></a><code >initializer_list&lt;Type&gt; object</code>:<blockquote >defines <code >object</code> as an empty initializer list</blockquote>
    <li><code >initializer_list&lt;Type&gt; object { list of Type values }</code>:<blockquote >defines <code >object</code> as an initializer list containing <code >Type</code> values</blockquote>
    <li><code >initializer_list&lt;Type&gt; object(other)</code>:<blockquote >initializes <code >object</code> using the values stored in <code >other</code></blockquote>
    <li><a name="an747"></a><code >size_t size() const</code>:<blockquote >returns the number of elements in the initializer list</blockquote>
    <li><a name="an748"></a><code >Type const *begin() const</code>:<blockquote >returns a pointer to the first element of the initializer list</blockquote>
    <li><a name="an749"></a><code >Type const *end() const</code>:<blockquote >returns a pointer just beyond the location of the last element of the
initializer list</blockquote>
    </ul>
<p>
<a name="DEFAULTED"></a><a name="l126"></a>
<h2 >7.6: Defaulted and deleted class members</h2>
In everyday class design two situations are frequently encountered:
    <ul>
        <li> A class offering constructors explicitly has to define a default
constructor;
        <li> A class (e.g., a class implementing a stream)
cannot initialize objects by copying the values from an existing object of
that class (called
 <a name="an750"></a><em >copy construction</em>) and cannot assign objects to each other.
    </ul>
    Once a class defines at least one constructor its default constructor is
not automatically defined by the compiler. <strong >C++</strong> relaxes that
restriction somewhat by offering the <a name="an751"></a>`<a name="an752"></a><code >= default</code>'
syntax. A class specifying `<code >= default</code>' with its default constructor
declaration indicates that the <a name="an753"></a>trivial default constructor should be
provided by the compiler. A trivial default constructor performs the following
actions:
    <ul>
    <li> Its data members of built-in or primitive types are not initialized;
    <li> Its composed (class type) data members are initialized by their
default constructors.
    <li> If the class is derived from a base class (cf. chapter
<a href="cplusplus13.html#INHERITANCE">13</a>) the base class is initialized by its default constructor.
    </ul>
    Trivial implementations can also be provided for the <em >copy constructor</em>,
the <em >overloaded assignment operator</em>, and the <em >destructor</em>. Those members
are introduced in chapter <a href="cplusplus09.html#MEMORY">9</a>.
<p>
Conversely, situations exist where some (otherwise automatically provided)
members should <em >not</em> be made available. This is realized by specifying
 <a name="an754"></a>`<a name="an755"></a><code >= delete</code>'. Using <code >= default</code> and <code >= delete</code> is illustrated
by the following example. The default constructor receives its trivial
implementation, copy-construction is prevented:
        <pre>
    class Strings
    {
        public:
            Strings() = default;
            Strings(std::string const *sp, size_t size);

            Strings(Strings const &amp;other) = delete;
    };
</pre>
<p>
<a name="ConstFunctions"></a><a name="l127"></a>
<h2 >7.7: Const member functions and const objects</h2>
The keyword <code >const</code> is often used behind the parameter list of member
functions. This keyword indicates that a member function does not alter the
data members of its object. Such member functions are called
    <a name="an756"></a><em >const member functions</em>. In the class <code >Person</code>, we see that the
accessor functions were declared <code >const</code>:
        <pre>
    class Person
    {
        public:
            std::string const &amp;name()    const;
            std::string const &amp;address() const;
            std::string const &amp;phone()   const;
            size_t mass()              const;
    };
</pre>
    The rule of thumb given in section <a href="cplusplus03.html#ConstRule">3.1.1</a> applies here too:
whichever appears to the <em >left</em> of the keyword <code >const</code>, is not
altered. With member functions this should be interpreted as `doesn't alter
its own data'.
<p>
When implementing a const member function the <code >const</code> attribute must be
repeated:
        <pre>
    string const &amp;Person::name() const
    {
        return d_name;
    }
</pre>
    The compiler prevents the data members of a class from being modified
by one of its const member functions. Therefore a statement like
        <pre>
    d_name[0] = toupper(static_cast&lt;unsigned char&gt;(d_name[0]));
</pre>
 results in a compiler error when added to the above function's definition.
<p>
<code >Const</code> member functions are used to prevent inadvertent data
modification. Except for constructors and the destructor (cf. chapter
<a href="cplusplus09.html#MEMORY">9</a>) only const member functions can be used with (plain, references
or pointers to) <code >const</code> objects.
<p>
Const objects are frequently encountered as <code >const &amp;</code> parameters of
functions. Inside such functions only the object's const members may be
used. Here is an example:
        <pre>
    void displayMass(ostream &amp;out, Person const &amp;person)
    {
        out &lt;&lt; person.name() &lt;&lt; " weighs " &lt;&lt; person.mass() &lt;&lt; " kg.\n";
    }
</pre>
    Since <code >person</code> is defined as a <code >Person const &amp;</code> the function
<code >displayMass</code> cannot call, e.g.,<br/>
    <code >person.setMass(75)</code>.
<p>
The <code >const</code> member function attribute can be used to
 <a name="an757"></a> overload member functions. When functions are
overloaded by their <code >const</code> attribute the compiler uses the member
function matching most closely the <a name="an758"></a>const-qualification of the object:
    <ul>
    <li> When the object is a <code >const</code> object, only <code >const</code> member
functions can be used.
    <li> When the object is not a <code >const</code> object, non-<code >const</code> member
functions are used, <em >unless</em> only a <code >const</code> member function is
available. In that case, the <code >const</code> member function is used.
    </ul>
    The next example illustrates how (non) <code >const</code> member functions are
selected:
        <pre>
    #include &lt;iostream&gt;
    using namespace std;

    class Members
    {
        public:
            Members();
            void member();
            void member() const;
    };

    Members::Members()
    {}
    void Members::member()
    {
        cout &lt;&lt; "non const member\n";
    }
    void Members::member() const
    {
        cout &lt;&lt; "const member\n";
    }

    int main()
    {
        Members const constObject;
        Members       nonConstObject;

        constObject.member();
        nonConstObject.member();
    }
    /*
            Generated output:

        const member
        non const member
    */
</pre>
    As a general principle of design: member functions should always be given
the <code >const</code> attribute, unless they actually modify the object's data.
<p>
<a name="ANONYMOUS"></a><a name="l128"></a>
<h3 >7.7.1: Anonymous objects</h3>
    Sometimes objects are used because they offer a certain functionality. The
objects only exist because of their functionality, and nothing in the objects
themselves is ever changed. The following class <code >Print</code> offers a facility to
print a string, using a configurable prefix and suffix. A partial class
interface could be:
        <pre>
    class Print
    {
        public:
            Print(ostream &amp;out);
            void print(std::string const &amp;prefix, std::string const &amp;text,
                     std::string const &amp;suffix) const;
    };
</pre>
    An interface like this would allow us to do things like:
        <pre>
    Print print{ cout };
    for (int idx = 0; idx != argc; ++idx)
        print.print("arg: ", argv[idx], "\n");
</pre>
    This works fine, but it could greatly be improved if we could pass
<code >print</code>'s invariant arguments to <code >Print</code>'s constructor.  This would
simplify <code >print</code>'s prototype (only one argument would need to be passed
rather than three) and we could wrap the above code in a function
expecting a <code >Print</code> object:
        <pre>
    void allArgs(Print const &amp;print, int argc, char **argv)
    {
        for (int idx = 0; idx != argc; ++idx)
            print.print(argv[idx]);
    }
</pre>
    The above is a fairly generic piece of code, at least it is with respect
to <code >Print</code>. Since <code >prefix</code> and <code >suffix</code> don't change they can be passed
to the constructor which could be given  the prototype:
        <pre>
    Print(ostream &amp;out, string const &amp;prefix = "", string const &amp;suffix = "");
</pre>
    Now <code >allArgs</code> may be used as follows:
        <pre>
    Print p1{ cout, "arg: ", "\n" };    // prints to cout
    Print p2{ cerr, "err: --", "--\n" };// prints to cerr

    allArgs(p1, argc, argv);            // prints to cout
    allArgs(p2, argc, argv);            // prints to cerr
</pre>
    But now we note that <code >p1</code> and <code >p2</code> are only used inside the
<code >allArgs</code> function. Furthermore, as we can see from <code >print</code>'s prototype,
<code >print</code> doesn't modify the internal data of the <code >Print</code> object it is
using.
<p>
In such situations it is actually not necessary to define objects before
they are used. Instead <a name="an759"></a><em >anonymous object</em><em >s</em><a name="an760"></a> may be
used. Anonymous objects can be used:
    <ul>
    <li> to initialize a function parameter which is a <code >const</code> reference to
an object;
    <li> if the object is <em >only</em> used inside the function call.
    </ul>
    When passing anonymous objects as arguments of <code >const &amp;</code> parameters of
functions they are considered constant as they merely exist for passing the
information of (class type) objects to those functions. This way, they cannot
be modified, nor may their non-const member functions be used.  Of course, a
<code >const_cast</code> could be used to cast away the const reference's constness, but
that's considered bad practice on behalf of the function receiving the
anonymous objects. Also, any modification to the anonymous object is lost once
the function returns as the anonymous object ceases to exist after calling the
function. These anonymous objects used to initialize const references should
not be confused with passing anonymous objects to parameters defined as rvalue
references (section <a href="cplusplus03.html#RREF">3.3.2</a>) which have a completely different purpose in
life. Rvalue references primarily exist to be `swallowed' by functions
receiving them. Thus, the information made available by rvalue references
outlives the rvalue reference objects which are also anonymous.
<p>
Anonymous objects are defined when a constructor is used without providing
a name for the constructed object. Here is the corresponding example:
        <pre>
    allArgs(Print{ cout, "arg: ", "\n" }, argc, argv);    // prints to cout
    allArgs(Print{ cerr, "err: --", "--\n" }, argc, argv);// prints to cerr
</pre>
    In this situation the <code >Print</code> objects are constructed and immediately
passed as first arguments to the <code >allArgs</code> functions, where they are
accessible as the function's <code >print</code> parameter. While the <code >allArgs</code>
function is executing they can be used, but once the function has completed,
the anonymous <code >Print</code> objects are no longer accessible.
<p>
<a name="l129"></a>
<h4>7.7.1.1: Subtleties with anonymous objects</h4>
        Anonymous objects can be used to initialize function parameters
that are <code >const</code> references to objects. These objects are created just
before such a function is called, and are destroyed once the function has
terminated. <strong >C++</strong>'s grammar allows us to use anonymous objects in other
situations as well. Consider the following snippet of code:
        <pre>
    int main()
    {
        // initial statements
        Print{ "hello", "world" };      // assume a matching constructor
                                        // is available
        // later statements
    }
</pre>
    In this example an anonymous <code >Print</code> object is constructed, and it is
immediately destroyed thereafter. So, following the `initial
statements' our <code >Print</code> object is constructed. Then it is destroyed again
followed by the execution of the `later statements'.
<p>
The example illustrates that the standard lifetime rules do not apply to
anonymous objects. <a name="an761"></a>
 <a name="an762"></a> Their lifetimes are limited to the
<em >statements</em>, rather than to the <em >end of the block</em> in which they are
defined.
<p>
Plain anonymous object are at least useful in one situation. Assume we
want to put <em >markers</em> in our code producing some output when the program's
execution reaches a certain point. An object's constructor could be
implemented so as to provide that marker-functionality allowing us to put
markers in our code by defining anonymous, rather than named objects.
<p>
<strong >C++</strong>'s grammar contains another remarkable characteristic illustrated
by the next example:
        <pre>
    int main(int argc, char **argv)
    {
              // assume a matching constructor is available:
        Print p{ cout, "", "" };            // 1
        allArgs(Print{ p }, argc, argv);    // 2
    }
</pre>
    In this example a non-anonymous object <code >p</code> is constructed in statement
1, which is then used in statement 2 to <em >initialize</em> an anonymous
object. The anonymous object, in turn, is then used to initialize
<code >allArgs</code>'s <code >const</code> reference parameter. This use of an existing object
to initialize another object is common practice, and is based on the existence
of a so-called
    <a name="an763"></a><em >copy constructor</em>. A copy constructor creates an object (as it is a
constructor) using an existing object's characteristics to initialize the data
of the object that's created. Copy constructors are discussed in depth in
chapter <a href="cplusplus09.html#MEMORY">9</a>, but presently only the concept of a copy constructor is
used.
<p>
In the above example a copy constructor is used to initialize an anonymous
object. The anonymous object was then used to initialize a parameter of a
function. However, when we try to apply the same trick (i.e., using an
existing object to initialize an anonymous object) to a plain statement, the
compiler generates an error: the object <code >p</code> can't be redefined (in statement
3, below):
        <pre>
    int main(int argc, char *argv[])
    {
        Print p{ "", "" };                  // 1
        allArgs(Print(p), argc, argv);      // 2
        Print(p);                           // 3 error!
    }
</pre>
    Does this mean that using an existing object to initialize an anonymous
object that is used as function argument is OK, while an existing object can't
be used to initialize an anonymous object in a plain statement?
<p>
The compiler actually provides us with the answer to this apparent
contradiction. About statement 3 the compiler reports something like:
        <pre>
    error: redeclaration of 'Print p'
</pre>
    which solves the problem when realizing that within a compound statement
objects and variables may be defined. Inside a compound statement, a
<em >type name</em> followed by a <code >variable name</code> is the grammatical form of a
variable definition. <em >Parentheses</em> can be used to break priorities, but if
there are no priorities to break, they have no effect, and are simply ignored
by the compiler. In statement 3 the parentheses allowed us to get rid of the
blank that's required between a type name and the variable name, but to the
compiler we wrote
        <pre>
        Print (p);
</pre>
    which is, since the parentheses are superfluous, equal to
        <pre>
        Print p;
</pre>
    thus producing <code >p</code>'s redeclaration.
<p>
As a further example: when we define a variable using a built-in type (e.g.,
<code >double</code>) using superfluous parentheses the compiler quietly removes
these parentheses for us:
        <pre>
    double ((((a))));       // weird, but OK.
</pre>
<p>
To summarize our findings about anonymous variables:
    <ul>
    <li> Anonymous objects are great for initializing <code >const</code> reference
parameters.
    <li> The same syntaxis, however, can also be used in stand-alone
statements, in which they are interpreted as variable definitions if our
intention actually was to initialize an anonymous object using an existing
object.
    <li> Since this may cause confusion, it's probably best to restrict the
use of anonymous objects to the first (and main) form: initializing function
parameters.
    </ul>

<a name="INLINE"></a><a name="l130"></a>
<h2 >7.8: The keyword `inline'</h2>
Let us take another look at the implementation of the function
<code >Person::name()</code>:
        <pre>
    std::string const &amp;Person::name() const
    {
        return d_name;
    }
</pre>
    This function is used to retrieve the name field of an object of the class
<code >Person</code>. Example:
        <pre>
    void showName(Person const &amp;person)
    {
        cout &lt;&lt; person.name();
    }
</pre>
    To insert <code >person</code>'s name the following actions are performed:
    <ul>
    <li> The function <code >Person::name()</code> is called.
    <li> This function returns <code >person</code>'s <code >d_name</code> as a reference.
    <li> The referenced name is inserted into <code >cout</code>.
    </ul>
    Especially the first part of these actions causes some time loss, since an
extra function call is necessary to retrieve the value of the <code >name</code> field.
Sometimes a faster procedure immediately making the <code >d_name</code> data member
available is preferred without ever actually calling a function
<code >name</code>. This can be realized using <a name="an764"></a><code >inline</code> functions. An inline
function is a request to the compiler to insert the function's code at the
location of the function's call. This may speed up execution by avoiding a
function call, which typically comes with some (stack handling and parameter
passing) overhead. Note that <code >inline</code> is a <em >request</em> to the compiler: the
compiler may decide to ignore it, and <em >will</em> probably ignore it when the
function's body contains much code. Good programming discipline suggests to be
aware of this, and to avoid <code >inline</code> unless the function's body is fairly
small. More on this in section <a href="cplusplus07.html#WHENINLINE">7.8.2</a>.
<p>
<a name="DEFINLINE"></a><a name="l131"></a>
<h3 >7.8.1: Defining members inline</h3>
    Inline functions may be implemented <em >in the class interface itself</em>. For the
class <code >Person</code> this results in the following implementation of <code >name</code>:
        <pre>
    class Person
    {
        public:
            std::string const &amp;name() const
            {
                return d_name;
            }
    };
</pre>
    Note that the <a name="an765"></a>inline code of the function <code >name</code> now literally
occurs inline in the interface of the class <code >Person</code>. The keyword <code >const</code>
is again added to the function's header.
<p>
Although members can be defined <a name="an766"></a> <em >in-class</em> (i.e.,
inside the class interface itself), it is considered bad practice
for the following reasons:
    <ul>
    <li> Defining members inside the interface contaminates the interface with
implementations. The interface's purpose is to document what functionality the
class offers. Mixing member declarations and implementation details
complicates understanding the interface. Readers need to skip implementation
details which takes time and makes it hard to grab the `broad picture', and
thus to understand at a glance what functionality the class's objects are
offering.
    <li> In-class implementations of private member functions may usually be
avoided altogether (as they are private members). They should be moved to the
internal header file (<em >unless</em> inline public members use such inline private
members).
    <li> Although members that are eligible for inline-coding should remain
inline, situations do exist where such inline members migrate from an inline
to a non-inline definition. In-class inline definitions still need editing
(sometimes considerable editing) before they can be compiled. This additional
editing is undesirable.
    </ul>
    Because of the above considerations inline members should not be defined
in-class. Rather, they should be defined following the class interface. The
<code >Person::name</code> member is therefore preferably defined as follows:
        <pre>
    class Person
    {
        public:
            std::string const &amp;name() const;
    };

    inline std::string const &amp;Person::name() const
    {
        return d_name;
    }
</pre>
<p>
If it is ever necessary to cancel <code >Person::name</code>'s inline
implementation, then this becomes its non-inline implementation:
        <pre>
    #include "person.ih"

    std::string const &amp;Person::name() const
    {
        return d_name;
    }
</pre>
    Only the <code >inline</code> keyword needs to be removed to obtain the correct
non-inline implementation.
<p>
Defining members inline has the following effect: whenever an inline-defined
function is called, the compiler may <em >insert the function's body</em> at the
location of the function call. It may be that the function itself is never
actually called.
<p>
This construction, where the function code itself is inserted rather than a
call to the function, is called an <a name="an767"></a>inline function.  Note that using inline
functions may result in multiple occurrences of the code of those functions in
a program: one copy for each invocation of the inline function. This is
probably OK if the function is a small one, and needs to be executed
fast. It's not so desirable if the code of the function is extensive. The
compiler knows this too, and handles the use of inline functions as a
<em >request</em> rather than a <em >command</em>. If the compiler considers the function
too long, it will not grant the request. Instead it will treat the function as
a normal function.
<p>
<a name="WHENINLINE"></a><a name="l132"></a>
<h3 >7.8.2: When to use inline functions</h3>
    When should <a name="an768"></a>inline functions be used, and when not? There are some
    <a name="an769"></a> rules of thumb which may be followed:
    <ul>
    <li> In general inline functions should <strong >not</strong> be used.
<em >Voil&agrave;</em>; that's simple, isn't it?
    <li> Consider defining a function inline once a fully developed and
tested program runs too slowly and shows `bottlenecks' in certain functions,
and the bottleneck is removed by defining inline members. A <a name="an770"></a>profiler, which
runs a program and determines where most of the time is spent, is necessary to
perform such optimizations.
    <li> Defining inline functions may be considered when they consist of
one very simple statement (such as the return statement in the function
<code >Person::name</code>).
    <li> When a function is defined inline, its implementation is inserted
in the code wherever the function is used. As a consequence, when the
<em >implementation</em> of the inline function changes, all sources using the
inline function must be recompiled. In practice that means that all functions
must be recompiled that include (either directly or indirectly) the header
file of the class in which the inline function is defined. Not a very
attractive prospect.
    <li> It is only useful to implement an inline function when the time spent
during a function call is long compared to the time spent by the function's
body. An example of an inline function which hardly affects the program's
speed is:
    <pre>
inline void Person::printname() const
{
    cout &lt;&lt; d_name &lt;&lt; '\n';
}
</pre>
    This function contains only one statement.  However, the statement takes a
relatively long time to execute. In general, functions which perform input and
output take lots of time. The effect of the conversion of this function
<code >printname()</code> to inline would therefore lead to an insignificant gain in
execution time.
    </ul>
    All inline functions <a name="an771"></a> have one disadvantage: the
actual code is inserted by the compiler and must therefore be known at
compile-time. Therefore, as mentioned earlier, an inline function can never be
located in a run-time library. Practically this means that an inline function
is found near the interface of a class, usually in the same header file. The
result is a header file which not only shows the <strong >declaration</strong> of a class,
but also part of its <strong >implementation</strong>, thus always blurring the distinction
between interface and implementation.
<p>

<h4>7.8.2.1: A prelude: when NOT to use inline functions</h4>
           <a name="an772"></a>
As a prelude to chapter <a href="cplusplus14.html#POLYMORPHISM">14</a> (Polymorphism), there is one
situation in which inline functions should definitely be avoided. At this
point in the <strong >C++</strong> Annotations it's a bit too early to expose the full details,
but since the keyword <code >inline</code> is the topic of this section this is
considered the appropriate location for the advice.
<p>
There are situations where the compiler is confronted with so-called
        <a name="an773"></a><em >vague linkage</em>
    <br/>(cf.
<a target=_top href="http://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc-4.6.0/gcc/Vague-Linkage.html">http://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc-4.6.0/gcc/Vague-Linkage.html</a>). These
situations occur when the compiler does not have a clear indication in what
object file to put its compiled code. This happens, e.g., with inline
functions, which are usually encountered in multiple source files. Since the
compiler may insert the code of ordinary inline functions in places where
these functions are called, vague linking is usually no problem with these
ordinary functions.
<p>
However, as explained in chapter <a href="cplusplus14.html#POLYMORPHISM">14</a>, when using polymorphism
the compiler must ignore the <code >inline</code> keyword and define so-called
<em >virtual members</em> as true (<em >out-of-line</em>)
        <a name="an774"></a>
    functions. In this situation the vague linkage may cause problems, as the
compiler must decide in what object <strong >s</strong> to put their code. Usually that's
not a big problem as long as the function is at least called once. But virtual
functions are special in the sense that they may very well never be explicitly
called. On some architectures (e.g., armel) the compiler may fail to compile
such inline virtual functions. This may result in missing symbols in programs
using them. To make matters slightly more complex: the problem may emerge when
shared libraries are used, but not when static libraries are used.
<p>
To avoid all of these problems virtual functions should <em >never</em> be defined
inline, but they should always be defined <em >out-of-line</em>. I.e., they should
be defined in source files.
<p>
<a name="l134"></a>
<h3 >7.8.3: Inline variables (C++17)</h3>
        In addition to inline functions, <a name="an775"></a> 
inline variables can be defined (and identically initialized) in multiple
translation units. E.g., a header file could contain
        <pre>
    inline int value = 15;                      // OK

    class Demo
    {
        // static int s_value = 15;             // ERROR
        static int constexpr s_value = 15;      // OK

        static int s_inline;                    // OK: see below: the inline 
                                                //   definition follows the 
                                                //   class declaration
    };
    inline int Demo::s_inline = 20;             // OK
</pre>
<p>
<a name="LOCAL"></a><a name="l135"></a>
<h2 >7.9: Local classes: classes inside functions</h2>
Classes are usually defined at the global or namespace level. However, it is
entirely possible to define <a name="an776"></a> a local class, i.e., inside a
function. Such classes are called <a name="an777"></a><em >local classes</em>.
<p>
Local classes can be very useful in advanced applications involving
inheritance or templates (cf. section <a href="cplusplus13.html#NONDEFINIT">13.8</a>). At this point in the
<strong >C++</strong> Annotations they have limited use, although their main features can be
described. At the end of this section an example is provided.
<p>
<ul>
    <li> Local classes may use almost all characteristics of normal classes.
They may have constructors, destructors, data members, and member functions;
    <li> Local classes cannot define static data members. Static member
functions, however, <em >can</em> be defined.
    <li> Since a local class may define static member functions, it is
possible to define <a name="an778"></a><em >nested functions</em> in <strong >C++</strong> somewhat comparable to the
way programming languages like <a name="an779"></a><strong >Pascal</strong> allow nested functions to be
defined.
    <li> If a local class needs access to a constant integral value, a
local <em >enum</em> can be used. The <code >enum</code> may be anonymous, exposing only the
<code >enum</code> values.
    <li> Local classes cannot directly access the non-static variables of their
surrounding context. For example, in the example shown below the class
<code >Local</code> cannot directly access <code >main</code>'s <code >argc</code> parameter.
    <li> Local classes may directly access global data and static variables
defined by their surrounding function. This includes variables defined in the
anonymous namespace of the source file containing the local class.
    <li> Local class objects can be defined inside the function body, but they
cannot leave the function as objects of their own type. I.e., a local class
name cannot be used for either the return type or for the parameter types of
its surrounding function.
    <li> As a prelude to <a name="an780"></a><em >inheritance</em> (chapter <a href="cplusplus13.html#INHERITANCE">13</a>):
a local class may be derived from an existing class allowing the surrounding
function to return a dynamically allocated locally constructed  class object,
pointer or reference via a base class pointer or reference.
    </ul>

<p>
<a name="MUTABLE"></a><a name="l136"></a>
<h2 >7.10: The keyword `mutable'</h2>
Earlier, in section <a href="cplusplus07.html#ConstFunctions">7.7</a>, the concepts of const member
functions and const objects were introduced.
<p>
<strong >C++</strong> also allows the declaration of data members which may be modified,
even by const member function. Declarations of such data members start with
the keyword <a name="an781"></a><code >mutable</code>.
<p>
Mutable should be used for those data members that may be modified without
logically changing the object, which might therefore still be considered a
constant object.
<p>
An example of a situation where <code >mutable</code> is appropriately used is found in
the implementation of a string class. Consider the <code >std::string</code>'s <code >c_str</code>
and <code >data</code> members. The actual data returned by the two members are
identical, but <code >c_str</code> must ensure that the returned string is terminated by
an 0-byte. As a string object has both a length and a capacity an easy
way to implement <code >c_str</code> is to ensure that the string's capacity exceeds its
length by at least one character. This invariant allows <code >c_str</code> to be
implemented as follows:
        <pre>
    char const *string::c_str() const
    {
        d_data[d_length] = 0;
        return d_data;
    }
</pre>
    This implementation logically does not modify the object's data as the
bytes beyond the object's initial (length) characters have undefined
values. But in order to use this implementation <code >d_data</code> must be declared
<code >mutable</code>:
        <pre>
    mutable char *d_data;
</pre>
<p>
The keyword <code >mutable</code> is also useful in classes implementing, e.g.,
reference counting. Consider a class implementing reference counting for
strings. The object doing the reference counting might be a const object,
but the class may define a copy constructor. Since const objects can't be
modified, how would the copy constructor be able to increment the reference
count? Here the <code >mutable</code> keyword may profitably be used, as it can be
incremented and decremented, even though its object is a const object.
<p>
The keyword <code >mutable</code> should sparingly be used. Data modified by const
member functions should never logically modify the object, and it should be
easy to demonstrate this.  As a <a name="an782"></a>rule of thumb: do not use <code >mutable</code>
unless there is a very clear reason (the object is logically not altered) for
violating this rule.
<p>
<a name="CLASSHEADER"></a><a name="l137"></a>
<h2 >7.11: Header file organization</h2>
In section <a href="cplusplus02.html#CHeaders">2.5.10</a> the requirements for header files when a <strong >C++</strong>
program also uses <strong >C</strong> functions were discussed.
 <a name="an783"></a> Header files containing class interfaces have additional
requirements.
<p>
First, source files. With the exception of the occasional classless
function, source files contain the code of member functions of classes.
Basically,  there are two approaches:
    <ul>
    <li> All required header files for a member function are included in each
individual source file.
    <li> All required header files (for all member functions of a class)
are included in a header file that is included by each of the source
files defining class members.
    </ul>
    The first alternative has the advantage of economy for the compiler: it
only needs to read the header files that are necessary for a particular source
file. It has the disadvantage that the program developer must include multiple
header files again and again in source files: it both takes time to type the
<code >include</code>-directives and to think about the header files which are needed in
a particular source file.
<p>
The second alternative has the advantage of economy for the program developer:
the header file of the class accumulates header files, so it tends to become
more and more generally useful. It has the disadvantage that the compiler
frequently has to process many header files which aren't actually used by the
function to compile.
<p>
With computers running faster and faster (and compilers getting smarter and
smarter) I think the second alternative is to be preferred over the first
alternative. So, as a starting point source files of a particular class
<code >MyClass</code> could be organized according to the following example:
        <pre>
    #include &lt;myclass.h&gt;

    int MyClass::aMemberFunction()
    {}
</pre>
    There is only one <code >include</code>-directive. Note that the directive refers to
a header file in a directory mentioned in the <a name="an784"></a><code >INCLUDE</code>-file environment
variable. Local header files (using <code >#include "myclass.h"</code>) could be used
too, but that tends to complicate the organization of the class header file
itself somewhat.
<p>
The organization of the header file itself requires some attention. Consider
the following example, in which two classes <code >File</code> and <code >String</code> are
used.
<p>
Assume the <code >File</code> class has a member <code >gets(String &amp;destination)</code>, while
the class <code >String</code> has a member function <code >getLine(File &amp;file)</code>. The
(partial) header file for the <code >class String</code> is then:
        <pre>
    #ifndef STRING_H_
    #define STRING_H_

    #include &lt;project/file.h&gt;   // to know about a File

    class String
    {
        public:
            void getLine(File &amp;file);
    };
    #endif
</pre>
    Unfortunately a similar setup is required for the class <code >File</code>:
        <pre>
    #ifndef FILE_H_
    #define FILE_H_

    #include &lt;project/string.h&gt;   // to know about a String

    class File
    {
        public:
            void gets(String &amp;string);
    };
    #endif
</pre>
    Now we have created a problem. The compiler, trying to compile the source
file of the function <code >File::gets</code> proceeds as follows:
    <ul>
    <li> The header file <code >project/file.h</code> is opened to be read;
    <li> <code >FILE_H_</code> is defined
    <li> The header file <code >project/string.h</code> is opened to be read
    <li> <code >STRING_H_</code> is defined
    <li> The header file <code >project/file.h</code> is (again) opened to be read
    <li> Apparently, <code >FILE_H_</code> is already defined, so the remainder of
            <code >project/file.h</code> is skipped.
    <li> The interface of the class <code >String</code> is now parsed.
    <li> In the class interface a reference to a <code >File</code> object is
            encountered.
    <li> As the <code >class File</code> hasn't been parsed yet, a <code >File</code> is still
        an undefined type, and the compiler quits with an error.
    </ul>
    The solution to this problem is to use a
 <a name="an785"></a><em >forward class reference</em> <em >before</em> the class interface, and to include
the corresponding class header file <em >beyond</em> the class interface. So we get:
        <pre>
    #ifndef STRING_H_
    #define STRING_H_

    class File;                 // forward reference

    class String
    {
        public:
            void getLine(File &amp;file);
    };

    #include &lt;project/file.h&gt;   // to know about a File

    #endif
</pre>
    A similar setup is required for the class <code >File</code>:
        <pre>
    #ifndef FILE_H_
    #define FILE_H_

    class String;               // forward reference

    class File
    {
        public:
            void gets(String &amp;string);
    };

    #include &lt;project/string.h&gt;   // to know about a String

    #endif
</pre>
    This works well in all situations where either references or pointers to
other classes are involved and with (non-inline) member functions having
    <a name="an786"></a>class-type return values or <a name="an787"></a> parameters.
<p>
This setup doesn't work with <a name="an788"></a>composition, nor with in-class inline
member functions. Assume the class <code >File</code> has a <em >composed</em> data member of
the class <code >String</code>. In that case, the class interface of the class <code >File</code>
<em >must</em> include the header file of the class <code >String</code> before the class
interface itself, because otherwise the compiler can't tell how big a <code >File</code>
object is. A <code >File</code> object contains a <code >String</code> member, but the compiler
can't determine the size of that <code >String</code> data member and thus, by
implication, it can't determine the size of a <code >File</code> object.
<p>
In cases where classes contain composed objects (or are derived from other
classes, see chapter <a href="cplusplus13.html#INHERITANCE">13</a>) the header files of the classes of the
composed objects must have been read <em >before</em> the class interface itself.
In such a case the <code >class File</code> might be defined as follows:
        <pre>
    #ifndef FILE_H_
    #define FILE_H_

    #include &lt;project/string.h&gt;     // to know about a String

    class File
    {
        String d_line;              // composition !

        public:
            void gets(String &amp;string);
    };
    #endif
</pre>
    The class <code >String</code> can't declare a <code >File</code> object as a composed member:
such a situation would again result in an undefined class while compiling the
sources of these classes.
<p>
All remaining header files (appearing below the class interface itself)
are required only because they are used by the class's source files.
<p>
This approach allows us to introduce yet another refinement:
    <ul>
    <li> Header files defining a class interface should <em >declare</em> what can
be declared before defining the class interface itself. So, classes that are
mentioned in a class interface  should be specified using
 <a name="an789"></a> forward declarations <em >unless</em>
        <ul>
        <li> They are a <em >base class</em> of the current class (see chapter
<a href="cplusplus13.html#INHERITANCE">13</a>);
        <li> They are the class types of composed data members;
        <li> They are used in inline member functions.
        </ul>
    In particular: additional actual header files are <em >not</em> required for:
        <ul>
            <li> class-type return values of functions;
            <li> class-type value parameters of functions.
        </ul>
    Class header files  of objects that are either composed or inherited
or that are used in inline functions, <em >must</em> be known to the compiler before
the interface of the current class starts.  The information in the header
file itself is protected by the <code >#ifndef ... #endif</code> construction introduced
in section <a href="cplusplus02.html#CHeaders">2.5.10</a>.
    <li> Program sources in which the class is used only need to include this
header file. <a name="an790"></a> <em >Lakos</em>, (2001) refines this process even
further. See his book <strong >Large-Scale <strong >C++</strong> Software Design</strong> for further
details. This header file should be made available in a well-known location,
such as a directory or subdirectory of the standard <a name="an791"></a><code >INCLUDE</code> path.
    <li> To implement member functions the class's header file is required
and usually additional header files (like the <code >string</code> header file) as
well. The class header file itself as well as these additional header files
should be included in a separate internal header file (for which the extension
<code >.ih</code> <a name="an792"></a> (`<a name="an793"></a>internal header') is suggested).
<p>
The <code >.ih</code> file should be defined in the same directory as the source
files of the class. It has the following characteristics:
        <ul>
        <li> There is <em >no</em> need for a protective <code >#ifndef</code> .. <code >#endif</code>
shield, as the header file is never included by other header files.
        <li> The standard <code >.h</code> header file defining the class interface
is included.
        <li> The header files of all classes used  as forward references in
the standard <code >.h</code> header file are included.
        <li> Finally, all other header files that are required in the source
files of the class are included.
        </ul>
    An example of such a header file organization is:
        <ul>
        <li> First part, e.g., <code >/usr/local/include/myheaders/file.h</code>:
    <pre>
#ifndef FILE_H_
#define FILE_H_

#include &lt;fstream&gt;      // for composed 'ifstream'

class Buffer;           // forward reference

class File              // class interface
{
    std::ifstream d_instream;

    public:
        void gets(Buffer &amp;buffer);
};
#endif
</pre>
        <li> Second part, e.g., <code >~/myproject/file/file.ih</code>, where all
sources of the class File are stored:
    <pre>
#include &lt;myheaders/file.h&gt; // make the class File known

#include &lt;buffer.h&gt;         // make Buffer known to File
#include &lt;string&gt;           // used by members of the class
#include &lt;sys/stat.h&gt;       // File.
</pre>
        </ul>
    </ul>

<h3 >7.11.1: Using namespaces in header files</h3>
    When entities from <a name="an794"></a> namespaces are used in <a name="an795"></a> header
files, no <a name="an796"></a><code >using</code> directive should be specified in those header
files if they are to be used as general header files declaring classes or
other entities from a <a name="an797"></a>library. When the <code >using</code> directive is used in a
header file then users of such a header file are forced to accept and use the
declarations in all code that includes the particular header file.
<p>
For example, if in a namespace <code >special</code> an object <code >Inserter cout</code> is
declared, then <code >special::cout</code> is of course a different object than
<code >std::cout</code>. Now, if a class <code >Flaw</code> is constructed, in which the
constructor expects a reference to a <code >special::Inserter</code>, then the class
should be constructed as follows:
        <pre>
    class special::Inserter;

    class Flaw
    {
        public:
            Flaw(special::Inserter &amp;ins);
    };
</pre>
    Now the person designing the class <code >Flaw</code> may be in a lazy mood, and
might get bored by continuously having to prefix <code >special::</code> before every
entity from that namespace. So, the following construction is used:
        <pre>
    using namespace special;

    class Inserter;
    class Flaw
    {
        public:
            Flaw(Inserter &amp;ins);
    };
</pre>
    This works fine, up to the point where somebody wants to include
<code >flaw.h</code> in other source files: because of the <code >using</code> directive, this
latter person is now by implication also <code >using namespace special</code>, which
could produce unwanted or unexpected effects:
        <pre>
    #include &lt;flaw.h&gt;
    #include &lt;iostream&gt;

    using std::cout;

    int main()
    {
        cout &lt;&lt; "starting\n";       // won't compile
    }
</pre>
    The compiler is confronted with two interpretations for <code >cout</code>: first,
because of the <code >using</code> directive in the <code >flaw.h</code> header file, it considers
<code >cout</code> a <code >special::Inserter</code>, then, because of the <code >using</code> directive in
the user program, it considers <code >cout</code> a <code >std::ostream</code>. Consequently,
the compiler reports an error.
<p>
As a <a name="an798"></a>rule of thumb, header files intended for general use
should not contain <code >using</code> declarations. This rule does not hold true for
header files which are only included by the sources of a class: here the
programmer is free to apply as many <code >using</code> declarations as desired, as
these directives never reach other sources.
<p>
<a name="l139"></a>
<h2 >7.12: Sizeof applied to class data members</h2>
In <strong >C++</strong> the well-known <a name="an799"></a><code >sizeof</code> operator can be applied to data
members of classes without the need to specify an object as well. Consider:
        <pre>
    class Data
    {
        std::string d_name;
        ...
    };
</pre>
    To obtain the size of <code >Data</code>'s <code >d_name</code> member the following
expression can be used:
        <pre>
    sizeof(Data::d_name);
</pre>
    However, note that the compiler observes data protection  here as
well. <code >Sizeof(Data::d_name)</code> can only be used where <code >d_name</code> may be
visible as well, i.e., by <code >Data</code>'s member functions and friends.
