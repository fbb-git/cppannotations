<h1 >Chapter 16: Classes Having Pointers To Members</h1>
Classes having <code >pointer data members</code> have been discussed in detail in
chapter <a href="cplusplus09.html#MEMORY">9</a>.  Classes defining pointer data-members deserve some
special attention, as they usually require the definitions of copy
constructors, overloaded assignment operators and destructors
<p>
Situations exist where we do not need a pointer to an object but rather a
 <a name="an1953"></a>pointer to members of a class. Pointers to members can profitably be used
to configure the behavior of objects of classes. Depending on which member a
pointer to a member points to objects will show certain behavior.
<p>
Although pointers to members have their use, polymorphism can frequently be
used to realize comparable behavior. Consider a class having a member
<code >process</code> performing one of a series of alternate behaviors. Instead of
selecting the behavior of choice at object construction time the class could
use the interface of some (abstract) base class, passing an object of some
derived class to its constructor and could thus configure its behavior. This
allows for easy, extensible and flexible configuration, but access to the
class's data members would be less flexible and would possibly require the use
of `friend' declarations. In such cases pointers to members may actually be
preferred as this allows for (somewhat less flexible) configuration as well as
direct access to a class's data members.
<p>
So the choice apparently is between on the one hand ease of configuration and
on the other hand ease of access to a class's data members. In this chapter
we'll concentrate on pointers to members, investigating what these pointers
have to offer.
<p>
<a name="l301"></a>
<h2 >16.1: Pointers to members: an example</h2>
    Knowing how pointers to variables and objects are used does not intuitively
lead to the concept of <em >pointers to members</em> <a name="an1954"></a>. Even if
the return types and parameter types of member functions are taken into
account, surprises can easily be encountered.  For example, consider the
following class:
        <pre>
    class String
    {
        char const *(*d_sp)() const;

        public:
            char const *get() const;
    };
</pre>
    For this class, it is not possible to let <code >char const *(*d_sp)() const</code>
point to the <code >String::get</code> member function as <code >d_sp</code> cannot be given the
address of the member function <code >get</code>.
<p>
One of the reasons why this doesn't work is that the variable <code >d_sp</code> has
<a name="an1955"></a><a name="an1956"></a>global scope (it is a pointer to <em >a</em> function, not a
pointer to a function within <code >String</code>), while the member function <code >get</code> is
defined within the <code >String</code> class, and thus has <code >class scope</code>. The fact
that <code >d_sp</code> is a data member of the class <code >String</code> is irrelevant
here. According to <code >d_sp</code>'s definition, it points to a function living
somewhere <em >outside</em> of the class.
<p>
Consequently, to define a pointer to a member (either data or function, but
usually a function) of a class, the scope of the pointer must indicate
<a name="an1957"></a><a name="an1958"></a>class scope.  Doing so, a pointer to the member
<code >String::get</code> is defined like this:
        <pre>
    char const *(String::*d_sp)() const;
</pre>
    So, by prefixing the <code >*d_sp</code> pointer data member by <code >String::</code>, it is
defined as a pointer in the context of the class <code >String</code>. According to its
definition it is <em >a pointer to a function in the class <code >String</code>, not
expecting arguments, not modifying its object's data, and returning a pointer
to constant characters</em>.
<p>
<a name="l302"></a>
<h2 >16.2: Defining  pointers to members</h2>
    Pointers <a name="an1959"></a> to members are defined by prefixing
the normal pointer notation with the appropriate class plus scope resolution
operator. Therefore, in the previous section, we used <code >char const *
(String::*d_sp)() const</code> to indicate that <code >d_sp</code>
    <ul>
    <li> is a pointer (<code >*d_sp</code>);
    <li> points to something in the class <code >String</code> (<code >String::*d_sp</code>);
    <li> is a pointer to a <code >const</code> function, returning a <code >char const *</code>
            (<code >char const * (String::*d_sp)() const</code>).
    </ul>
<p>
The prototype of a matching function is therefore:
        <pre>
    char const *String::somefun() const;
</pre>
 which is any <code >const</code> parameterless function in the class
<code >String</code>, returning a <code >char const *</code>.
<p>
When defining pointers to members the standard procedure for constructing
pointers to functions can still be applied:
    <ul>
    <li> put parentheses around the fully qualified function name (i.e., the
function's header, including the function's  class name):
        <pre>
char const * ( String::somefun ) () const
</pre>
    <li> Put a pointer (a star (<code >*</code>)) character immediately before the
function name itself:
        <pre>
char const * ( String:: * somefun ) () const
</pre>
    <li> Replace the function name with the name of the pointer variable:
        <pre>
char const * (String::*d_sp)() const
</pre>
    </ul>
<p>
Here is another example, defining <a name="an1960"></a> a pointer
to a data member. Assume the class <code >String</code> contains a <code >string d_text</code>
member. How to construct a pointer to this member? Again we follow standard
procedure:
    <ul>
    <li> put parentheses around the fully qualified variable name:
        <pre>
std::string (String::d_text)
</pre>
    <li> Put a pointer (a star (<code >*</code>)) character immediately before the
variable-name itself:
        <pre>
std::string (String::*d_text)
</pre>
    <li> Replace the variable name with the name of the pointer variable:
        <pre>
std::string (String::*tp)
</pre>
    In this case, the parentheses are superfluous and may be omitted:
        <pre>
string String::*tp
</pre>
    </ul>
<p>
Alternatively, a very simple <a name="an1961"></a>rule of thumb is
    <ul>
    <li> Define a normal (i.e., global) pointer variable,
    <li> Prefix the class name to the pointer character, once you point to
something inside a class
    </ul>
    For example, the following pointer to a global function
        <pre>
    char const * (*sp)() const;
</pre>
    becomes a pointer to a member function after prefixing the class-scope:
        <pre>
    char const * (String::*sp)() const;
</pre>
    Nothing forces us to define pointers to members in their target
(<code >String</code>) classes. Pointers to members <em >may</em> be defined in their target
classes (so they become data members), or in another class, or as a local
variable or as a global variable. In all these cases the pointer to member
variable can be given the address of the kind of member it points to. The
important part is that a pointer to member can be initialized or assigned
without requiring the existence an object of the pointer's target class.
<p>
Initializing or assigning an address to such a pointer merely indicates to
which member the pointer points. This can be considered some kind of
 <a name="an1962"></a><em >relative address</em>; relative to the object for which the function is
called. No object is required when pointers to members are initialized or
assigned. While it is allowed to initialize or assign a pointer to member, it
is (of course) not possible to <em >call</em> those members without specifying an
object of the correct type.
<p>
In the following example <a name="an1963"></a>
    <a name="an1964"></a> initialization of and assignment to
pointers to members is illustrated (for illustration purposes all members of
the class <code >PointerDemo</code> are defined <code >public</code>). In the example itself the
<code >&amp;</code>-operator is used to determine the addresses of the members. These
operators as well as the class-scopes are required. Even when used inside
member implementations:
        <pre>
    #include &lt;cstddef&gt;

    class PointerDemo
    {
        public:
            size_t d_value;
            size_t get() const;
    };

    inline size_t PointerDemo::get() const
    {
        return d_value;
    }

    int main()
    {                                           // initialization
        size_t (PointerDemo::*getPtr)() const = &amp;PointerDemo::get;
        size_t PointerDemo::*valuePtr         = &amp;PointerDemo::d_value;

        getPtr   = &amp;PointerDemo::get;           // assignment
        valuePtr = &amp;PointerDemo::d_value;
    }
</pre>
<p>
This involves nothing special. The difference with pointers at
global scope is that we're now restricting ourselves to the scope of the
<code >PointerDemo</code> class. Because of this restriction, all <em >pointer</em>
definitions and all variables whose addresses are used must be given the
<code >PointerDemo</code> class scope.
<p>
Pointers to members can also be used with <code >virtual</code>
        <a name="an1965"></a>
    member functions. No special syntax is required when pointing to virtual
members. Pointer construction, initialization and assignment is done
identically to the way it is done with non-virtual members.
<p>
<a name="l303"></a>
<h2 >16.3: Using pointers to members</h2>
    Using pointers to members to call a member function requires the existence of
an object of the class of the members to which the pointer to member refers
to.  With pointers operating at global scope, the dereferencing operator <code >*</code>
is used.  With pointers to objects the <a name="an1966"></a>field selector operator operating on
pointers (<a name="an1967"></a><code >-&gt;</code>) or the field selector operating operating on objects (<code >.</code>)
can be used to select appropriate members.
<p>
To use a pointer to member in combination with an object the
    <a name="an1968"></a>pointer to member field selector (<a name="an1969"></a><code >.*</code>) must be specified.  To use a
pointer to a member via a pointer to an object the `pointer to member field
selector through a pointer to an object' (<a name="an1970"></a><code >-&gt;*</code>) must be specified. These
two operators combine the notions of a field selection (the <code >.</code> and <code >-&gt;</code>
parts) to reach the appropriate field in an object and of dereferencing: a
dereference operation is used to reach the function or variable the pointer to
member points to.
<p>
Using the example from the previous section, let's see how we can use
pointers to member functions and pointers to data members:
        <pre>
    #include &lt;iostream&gt;

    class PointerDemo
    {
        public:
            size_t d_value;
            size_t get() const;
    };

    inline size_t PointerDemo::get() const
    {
        return d_value;
    }

    using namespace std;

    int main()
    {                                           // initialization
        size_t (PointerDemo::*getPtr)() const = &amp;PointerDemo::get;
        size_t PointerDemo::*valuePtr   = &amp;PointerDemo::d_value;

        PointerDemo object;                     // (1) (see text)
        PointerDemo *ptr = &amp;object;

        object.*valuePtr = 12345;               // (2)
        cout &lt;&lt; object.*valuePtr &lt;&lt; '\n' &lt;&lt;
                object.d_value &lt;&lt; '\n';

        ptr-&gt;*valuePtr = 54321;                 // (3)
        cout &lt;&lt; object.d_value &lt;&lt; '\n' &lt;&lt;
                (object.*getPtr)() &lt;&lt; '\n' &lt;&lt;   // (4)
                (ptr-&gt;*getPtr)() &lt;&lt; '\n';
    }
</pre>
<p>
We note:
    <ul>
    <li> At (1) a <code >PointerDemo</code> object and a pointer to such an
object is defined.
    <li> At (2) we specify an object (and hence the <code >.*</code> operator) to reach
the member <code >valuePtr</code> points to. This member is given a value.
    <li> At (3) the same member is assigned another value, but this time using
the pointer to a <code >PointerDemo</code> object. Hence we use the <code >-&gt;*</code> operator.
    <li> At (4) the <code >.*</code> and <code >-&gt;*</code> are used once again, this time to call
a function through a pointer to member. As the function argument list
has a higher priority than the pointer to member field selector
operator, the latter <em >must</em> be protected by parentheses.
    </ul>
    Pointers to members can be used profitably in situations where a class has
a member that behaves differently depending on a configuration
setting. Consider once again the class <code >Person</code> from section
<a href="cplusplus09.html#ASSIGNMENT">9.3</a>. <code >Person</code> defines data members holding a person's name,
address and phone number. Assume we want to construct a <code >Person</code>
database of employees.  The employee database can be queried, but depending on
the kind of person querying the database either the name, the name and phone
number or all stored information about the person is made available. This
implies that a member function like <code >address</code> must return something like
`<code >&lt;not available&gt;</code>' in cases where the person querying the database is not
allowed to see the person's address, and the actual address in other cases.
<p>
The employee database is opened specifying an argument reflecting the
status of the employee who wants to make some queries. The status could
reflect his or her position in the organization, like <code >BOARD</code>,
<code >SUPERVISOR</code>, <code >SALESPERSON</code>, or <code >CLERK</code>. The first two categories are
allowed to see all information about the employees, a <code >SALESPERSON</code> is
allowed to see the employee's phone numbers, while the <code >CLERK</code> is only
allowed to verify whether a person is actually a member of the organization.
<p>
We now construct a member <code >string personInfo(char const *name)</code> in the
database class. A standard implementation of this class could be:
        <pre>
    string PersonData::personInfo(char const *name)
    {
        Person *p = lookup(name);   // see if `name' exists

        if (!p)
            return "not found";

        switch (d_category)
        {
            case BOARD:
            case SUPERVISOR:
                return allInfo(p);
            case SALESPERSON:
                return noPhone(p);
            case CLERK:
                return nameOnly(p);
        }
    }
</pre>
    Although it doesn't take much time, the <code >switch</code> must nonetheless be
evaluated every time <code >personInfo</code> is called. Instead of using a switch, we
could define a member <code >d_infoPtr</code> as a pointer to a member function of the
class <code >PersonData</code> returning a <code >string</code> and expecting a pointer to a
<code >Person</code> as its argument.
<p>
Instead of evaluating the switch this pointer can be used to point to
<code >allInfo</code>, <code >noPhone</code> or <code >nameOnly</code>. Furthermore, the member function
the pointer points to will be known by the time the <code >PersonData</code>
object is constructed and so its value needs to be determined only once (at
the PersonData object's construction time).
<p>
Having initialized <code >d_infoPtr</code> the <code >personInfo</code> member function is now
implemented simply as:
        <pre>
    string PersonData::personInfo(char const *name)
    {
        Person *p = lookup(name);       // see if `name' exists

        return p ? (this-&gt;*d_infoPtr)(p) :  "not found";
    }
</pre>
<p>
The member <code >d_infoPtr</code> is defined as follows (within the class
<code >PersonData</code>, omitting other members):
        <pre>
    class PersonData
    {
        string (PersonData::*d_infoPtr)(Person *p);
    };
</pre>
    Finally, the constructor initializes <code >d_infoPtr</code>. This could be realized
using a simple switch:
        <pre>
    PersonData::PersonData(PersonData::EmployeeCategory cat)
    :
        switch (cat)
        {
            case BOARD:
            case SUPERVISOR:
                d_infoPtr = &amp;PersonData::allInfo;
            break;
            case SALESPERSON:
                d_infoPtr = &amp;PersonData::noPhone;
            break;
            case CLERK:
                d_infoPtr = &amp;PersonData::nameOnly;
            break;
        }
    }
</pre>
    Note how addresses of member functions are determined. The class
<code >PersonData</code> scope <em >must</em> be specified, even though we're already inside
a member function of the class <code >PersonData</code>.
<p>
An example using pointers to data members is provided in section
<a href="cplusplus19.html#STABSORT">19.1.60</a>, in the context of the <code >stable_sort</code> generic algorithm.
<p>
<a name="l304"></a>
<h2 >16.4: Pointers to static members</h2>
    Static <a name="an1971"></a> members of a class can be used without having
available an object of their class. Public static members can be called like
free functions, albeit that their class names must be specified when they are
called.
<p>
Assume a class <code >String</code> has a public static member function
<code >count</code>, returning the number of string objects created so
far. Then, without using any <code >String</code> object the function
<code >String::count</code> may be called:
        <pre>
    void fun()
    {
        cout &lt;&lt; String::count() &lt;&lt; '\n';
    }
</pre>
    <em >Public</em> static members can be called like free functions (but see also
section <a href="cplusplus08.html#CALLINGCONVENTION">8.2.1</a>).  <em >Private</em> static members can only be
called within the context of their class, by their class's member or friend
functions.
<p>
Since static members have no associated objects their addresses can be
stored in ordinary function pointer variables, operating at the global
level. Pointers to members cannot be used to store addresses of static
members. Example:
        <pre>
    void fun()
    {
        size_t (*pf)() = String::count;
                // initialize pf with the address of a static member function

        cout &lt;&lt; (*pf)() &lt;&lt; '\n';
                // displays the value returned by String::count()
    }
</pre>
<p>
<a name="l305"></a>
<h2 >16.5: Pointer sizes</h2>
    An interesting characteristic of pointers to members is that their sizes
 <a name="an1972"></a><a name="an1973"></a> differ from
those of `normal' pointers. Consider the following little program:
        <pre>
    #include &lt;string&gt;
    #include &lt;iostream&gt;

    class X
    {
        public:
            void fun();
            std::string d_str;
    };
    inline void X::fun()
    {
        std::cout &lt;&lt; "hello\n";
    }

    using namespace std;
    int main()
    {
        cout &lt;&lt;
           "size of pointer to data-member:     " &lt;&lt; sizeof(&amp;X::d_str) &lt;&lt; "\n"
           "size of pointer to member function: " &lt;&lt; sizeof(&amp;X::fun) &lt;&lt; "\n"
           "size of pointer to non-member data: " &lt;&lt; sizeof(char *) &lt;&lt; "\n"
           "size of pointer to free function:   " &lt;&lt; sizeof(&amp;printf) &lt;&lt; '\n';
    }

    /*
        generated output (on 32-bit architectures):

        size of pointer to data-member:     4
        size of pointer to member function: 8
        size of pointer to non-member data: 4
        size of pointer to free function:   4
    */
</pre>
<p>
On a 32-bit architecture a pointer to a member function requires eight
bytes, whereas other kind of pointers require four bytes (Using Gnu's g++
compiler).
<p>
Pointer sizes are hardly ever explicitly used, but their sizes may cause
confusion in statements like:
        <pre>
    printf("%p", &amp;X::fun);
</pre>
    Of course, <code >printf</code> is likely not the right tool to produce the
value of these <strong >C++</strong> specific pointers. The values of these pointers can be
inserted into streams when a <code >union</code>, reinterpreting the 8-byte pointers as
a series of size_t <code >char</code> values, is used:
        <pre>
    #include &lt;string&gt;
    #include &lt;iostream&gt;
    #include &lt;iomanip&gt;

    class X
    {
        public:
            void fun();
            std::string d_str;
    };
    inline void X::fun()
    {
        std::cout &lt;&lt; "hello\n";
    }

    using namespace std;
    int main()
    {
        union
        {
            void (X::*f)();
            unsigned char *cp;
        }
            u = { &amp;X::fun };

        cout.fill('0');
        cout &lt;&lt; hex;
        for (unsigned idx = sizeof(void (X::*)()); idx-- &gt; 0; )
            cout &lt;&lt; setw(2) &lt;&lt; static_cast&lt;unsigned&gt;(u.cp[idx]);
        cout &lt;&lt; '\n';
    }
</pre>
