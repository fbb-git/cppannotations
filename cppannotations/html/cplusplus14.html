<h1 >Chapter 14: Polymorphism</h1>
Using inheritance classes may be derived from other classes, called base
classes. In the previous chapter we saw that base class pointers may be used
to point to derived class objects. We also saw that when a base class pointer
points to an object of a derived class the pointer's type, rather than the
object's type, determines which member functions are visible. So when a
<code >Vehicle *vp</code>, points to a <code >Car</code> object <code >Car</code>'s <code >speed</code> or
<code >brandName</code> members can't be used.
<p>
In the previous chapter two fundamental ways classes may be related to each
other were discussed: a class may be <a name="an1756"></a><em >implemented-in-terms-of</em> another
class and it can be stated that a derived class <a name="an1757"></a><em >is-a</em> base class. The
former relationship is usually implemented using composition, the latter
is usually implemented using a special form of inheritance, called
<a name="an1758"></a><em >polymorphism</em>, the topic of this chapter.
<p>
An <em >is-a</em> relationship between classes allows us to apply the
 <a name="an1759"></a><em >Liskov Substitution Principle</em> (<a name="an1760"></a><em >LSP</em>) according to which a derived
class object may be passed to and used by code expecting a pointer or
reference to a base class object. In the <strong >C++</strong> Annotations so far the LSP has been
applied many times. Every time an <code >ostringstream, ofstream</code> or <code >fstream</code>
was passed to functions expecting an <code >ostream</code> we've been applying this
principle. In this chapter we'll discover how to design our own classes
accordingly.
<p>
LSP is implemented using a technique called <a name="an1761"></a><em >polymorphism</em>: although a base
class pointer is used it performs actions defined in the (derived) class
of the object it actually points to. So, a <code >Vehicle *vp</code> might behave like
a <code >Car *</code> when pointing to a <code >Car</code>&nbsp;(In one of the StarTrek
movies, Capt.  Kirk was in trouble, as usual. He met an extremely beautiful
lady who, however, later on changed into a hideous troll. Kirk was quite
surprised, but the lady told him: ``Didn't you know I am a polymorph?'').
<p>
Polymorphism is implemented using a feature called <a name="an1762"></a><em >late binding</em>. It's
called that way because the decision <em >which</em> function to call (a base class
function or a function of a derived class) cannot be made at <em >compile-time</em>,
but is postponed until the program is actually executed: only then it is
determined which member function will actually be called.
<p>
In <strong >C++</strong> late binding is <em >not</em> the default way functions are called. By
default <a name="an1763"></a><em >static binding</em> (or <a name="an1764"></a><em >early binding</em>) is used. With static
binding the functions that are called are determined by the compiler, merely
using the class types of objects, object pointers or object references.
<p>
Late binding is an inherently different (and slightly slower) process as it is
decided at <a name="an1765"></a>run-time, rather than at <a name="an1766"></a>compile-time what function is going
to be called. As <strong >C++</strong> supports <em >both</em> late- and early-binding <strong >C++</strong>
programmers are offered an option as to what kind of binding to use.  Choices
can be optimized to the situations at hand. Many other languages offering
object oriented facilities (e.g., <strong >Java</strong>) only or by default offer late
binding. <strong >C++</strong> programmers should be keenly aware of this. Expecting early
binding and getting late binding may easily produce nasty bugs.
<p>
Let's look at a simple example to start appreciating the differences between
late and early binding. The example merely illustrates. Explanations of
<em >why</em> things are as shown are shortly provided.
<p>
Consider the  following little program:
        <pre>
    #include &lt;iostream&gt;
    using namespace std;

    class Base
    {
        protected:
            void hello()
            {
                cout &lt;&lt; "base hello\n";
            }
        public:
            void process()
            {
                hello();
            }
    };
    class Derived: public Base
    {
        protected:
            void hello()
            {
                cout &lt;&lt; "derived hello\n";
            }
    };
    int main()
    {
        Derived derived;

        derived.process();
    }
</pre>
    The important characteristic of the above program is the <code >Base::process</code>
function, calling <code >hello</code>. As <code >process</code> is the only member that is defined
in the public interface it is the only member that can be called by code not
belonging to the two classes. The class <code >Derived</code>, derived from <code >Base</code>
clearly inherits <code >Base</code>'s interface and so <code >process</code> is also available in
<code >Derived</code>. So the <code >Derived</code> object in <code >main</code> is able to call
<code >process</code>, but not <code >hello</code>.
<p>
So far, so good. Nothing new, all this was covered in the previous
chapter.  One may wonder why <code >Derived</code> was defined at all.  It was
presumably defined to create an implementation of <code >hello</code> that's appropriate
for <code >Derived</code> but differing from <code >Base::hello</code>'s
implementation. <code >Derived</code>'s author's reasoning was as follows: <code >Base</code>'s
implementation of <code >hello</code> is not appropriate; a <code >Derived</code> class object can
remedy that by providing an appropriate implementation. Furthermore our author
reasoned:
    <blockquote >``since the type of an
object determines the interface that is used, <code >process</code> must call
<code >Derived::hello</code> as <code >hello</code> is called via <code >process</code> from a <code >Derived</code>
class object''.</blockquote>
<p>
Unfortunately our author's reasoning is flawed, due to static binding. When
<code >Base::process</code> was compiled static binding caused the compiler to bind
the <code >hello</code> call to <code >Base::hello()</code>.
<p>
The author <em >intended</em> to create a <code >Derived</code> class that <code >is-a</code> <code >Base</code>
class. That only partially succeeded: <code >Base</code>'s interface was inherited, but
after that <code >Derived</code> has relinquished all control over what happens. Once
we're in <code >process</code> we're only able to see <code >Base</code>'s member
implementations. Polymorphism offers a way out, allowing us to redefine (in a
derived class) members of a base class allowing these redefined members to be
used from the base class's interface.
<p>
This is the essence of LSP: public inheritance should not be used to reuse the
base class members (in derived classes) but to be reused (by the base class,
polymorphically using derived class members reimplementing base class
members).
<p>
Take a second to appreciate the implications of the above little program. The
<code >hello</code> and <code >process</code> members aren't too impressive, but the implications
of the example are. The <code >process</code> member could implement directory travel,
<code >hello</code> could define the action to perform when encountering a
file. <code >Base::hello</code> might simply show the name of a file, but
<code >Derived::hello</code> might delete the file; might only list its name if its
younger than a certain age; might list its name if it contains a certain text;
etc., etc.. Up to now <code >Derived</code> would have to implement <code >process</code>'s
actions itself; Up to now code expecting a <code >Base</code> class reference or pointer
could only perform <code >Base</code>'s actions. Polymorphism allows us to reimplement
members of base classes and to use those reimplemented members in code
expecting base class references or pointers. Using polymorphism existing code
may be reused by derived classes reimplementing the appropriate members of
their base classes. It's about time to uncover how this magic can be realized.
<p>
Polymorphism, which is not
the default in <strong >C++</strong>, solves the problem and allows the author of the
classes to reach its goal. For the curious reader: prefix <code >void hello()</code> in
the <code >Base</code> class with the keyword <code >virtual</code> and recompile. Running the
modified program produces the intended and expected <code >derived hello</code>. Why
this happens is explained next.
<p>

<h2 >14.1: Virtual functions</h2>
By default the behavior of a member function called via a pointer or reference
is determined by the implementation of that function in the pointer's or
reference's class. E.g., a <code >Vehicle *</code> activates <code >Vehicle</code>'s member
functions, even when pointing to an object of a derived class. This is known
as as <em >early</em> or
    <a name="an1767"></a> <a name="an1768"></a> <em >static</em> binding: the function to
call is determined at
 <a name="an1769"></a>compile-time. In <strong >C++</strong> <em >late</em>
 <a name="an1770"></a> or <a name="an1771"></a> <em >dynamic</em> binding is realized using
<em >virtual member functions</em>.
<p>
A member function becomes a <a name="an1772"></a>virtual member function when its declaration
starts with the keyword <a name="an1773"></a><code >virtual</code>. It is stressed once again that in
<strong >C++</strong>, different from several other object oriented languages, this is
<em >not</em> the default situation. By default <em >static</em> binding is used.
<p>
Once a function is declared <code >virtual</code> in a base class, it remains virtual in
all derived classes. The keyword <code >virtual</code> should not be mentioned for
members in derived classes which are declared virtual in base classes. In
derived classes those members should be provided with the <a name="an1774"></a><code >override</code>
indicator, allowing the compiler to verify that you're indeed referring to an
existing virtual member function.
<p>
In the vehicle classification system (see section <a href="cplusplus13.html#VehicleSystem">13.1</a>), let's
concentrate on the members <code >mass</code> and <code >setMass</code>. These members define the
<a name="an1775"></a><em >user interface</em> of the class <code >Vehicle</code>. What we would like to accomplish
is that this user interface can be used for <code >Vehicle</code> and for any class
inheriting from <code >Vehicle</code>, since objects of those classes are themselves
also <code >Vehicles</code>. 
<p>
If we can define the user interface of our base class (e.g., <code >Vehicle</code>) such
that it remains usable irrespective of the classes we derive from <code >Vehicle</code>
our software achieves an enormous reusability: we design or software around
<code >Vehicle's</code> user interface, and our software will also properly function for
derived classes. Using plain inheritance doesn't accomplish this. If we define 
        <pre>
    std::ostream &amp;operator&lt;&lt;(std::ostream &amp;out, Vehicle const &amp;vehicle)
    {
        return out &lt;&lt; "Vehicle's mass is " &lt;&lt; vehicle.mass() &lt;&lt; " kg.";
    }
</pre>
    and <code >Vehicle's</code> member <code >mass</code> returns 0, but <code >Car's</code> member
<code >mass</code> returns 1000, then twice a mass of 0 is reported when the following
program is executed:
        <pre>
    int main()
    {
        Vehicle vehicle;
        Car vw(1000);

        cout &lt;&lt; vehicle &lt;&lt; '\n' &lt;&lt; vw &lt;&lt; endl;
    }
</pre>
<p>
We've defined an overloaded insertion operator, but since it only knows
about <code >Vehicle's</code> user interface, `<code >cout &lt;&lt; vw</code>' will use <code >vw's
Vehicle's</code> user interface as well, thus displaying a mass of 0. 
<p>
Reusablility is enhanced if we add a <em >redefinable interface</em> to the base
class's interface. A redefinable interface allows derived classes to fill in
their own implementation, without affecting the user interface. At the same
time the user interface will behave according to the derived class's wishes,
and not just to the base class's default implementation.
<p>
Members of the reusable interface should be declared in the class's
private sections: conceptually they merely belong to their own classes
(cf. section <a href="cplusplus14.html#INHERITWHY">14.7</a>). In the base class these members should be
declared <code >virtual</code>. These members can be redefined (overridden) by derived
classes, and should there be provided with <code >override</code> indicators.
<p>
We keep our user interface (<code >mass</code>), and add the redefinable member 
<code >vmass</code> to <code >Vehicle's</code> interface:
        <pre>
    class Vehicle
    {
        public:
            size_t mass() const;
            size_t si_mass() const;    // see below

        private:
            virtual size_t vmass() const;
    };
</pre>
    Separating the user interface from the redefinable interface is a sensible
thing to do. It allows us to fine-tune the user interface (only one point of
maintenance), while at the same time allowing us to standardize the expected
behavior of the members of the redefinable interface. E.g., in many countries
the International system of units is used, using the kilogram as the unit for
mass. Some countries use other units (like the <em >lbs</em>: 1 kg being
approx. 2.2046 lbs). By separating the user interface from the redefinable
interface we can use one standard for the redefinable interface, and keep the
flexibility of transforming the information <em >ad-lib</em> in the user
interface. 
<p>
Just to maintain a clean separation of user- and redefinable interface we
might consider adding another accessor to <code >Vehicle</code>, providing the
<code >si_mass</code>, simply implemented like this:
        <pre>
    size_t Vehicle::si_mass() const
    {
        return vmass();
    }
</pre>
<p>
If <code >Vehicle</code> supports a member <code >d_massFactor</code> then its <code >mass</code> member can
be implemented like this:
        <pre>
    size_t Vehicle::mass()
    {
        return d_massFactor * si_mass();
    }
</pre>
    <code >Vehicle</code> itself could define <code >vmass</code> so that it returns a token
value. E.g.,
        <pre>
    size_t Vehicle::vmass()
    {
        return 0;
    }
</pre>
<p>
Now let's have a look at the class <code >Car</code>. It is derived from
<code >Vehicle</code>, and it inherits <code >Vehicle's</code> user interface. It also has a data
member <code >size_t d_mass</code>, and it implements its own reusable interface:
        <pre>
    class Car: public Vehicle
    {
        ...
        private:
            size_t vmass() override;
    }
</pre>
        If <code >Car</code> constructors require us to specify the car's mass (stored
in <code >d_mass</code>), then <code >Car</code> simply implements its <code >vmass</code> member like
this:
        <pre>
    size_t Car::vmass() const
    {
        return d_mass;
    }
</pre>
<p>
The class <code >Truck</code>, inheriting from <code >Car</code> needs two mass values: the
tractor's mass and the trailer's mass. The tractor's mass is passed to its
<code >Car</code> base class, the trailor's mass is passed to its <code >Vehicle d_trailor</code>
data member. <code >Truck</code>, too, overrides <code >vmass</code>, this time returning the sum
of its tractor and trailor masses:
        <pre>
    size_t Truck::vmass() const
    {
        return Car::si_mass() + d_trailer.si_mass();
    }
</pre>
<p>
Once a class member has been declared <code >virtual</code> it becomes
a virtual member in all derived classes, whether or not these members are
provided with the <code >override</code> indicator. But <code >override</code> <em >should</em> be used,
as it allows to compiler to catch typos when writing down the derived class
interface. 
<p>
A member function may be declared <code >virtual</code> <em >anywhere</em> in a
    <a name="an1776"></a>class hierarchy, but this probably defeats the underlying polymorphic
class design, as the original base class is no longer capable of completely
covering the redefinable interfaces of derived classes. If, e.g, <code >mass</code> is
declared virtual in <code >Car</code>, but not in <code >Vehicle</code>, then the specific
characteristics of virtual member functions would only be available for
<code >Car</code> objects and for objects of classes derived from <code >Car</code>. For a
<code >Vehicle</code> pointer or reference static binding would remain to be used.  
<p>
The effect of late binding (polymorphism) is illustrated below:
        <pre>
    void showInfo(Vehicle &amp;vehicle)
    {
        cout &lt;&lt; "Info: " &lt;&lt; vehicle &lt;&lt; '\n';
    }

    int main()
    {
        Car car(1200);            // car with mass 1200
        Truck truck(6000, 115,      // truck with cabin mass 6000, 
              "Scania", 15000);     // speed 115, make Scania, 
                                    // trailer mass 15000

        showInfo(car);             // see (1) below
        showInfo(truck);            // see (2) below

        Vehicle *vp = &amp;truck;
        cout &lt;&lt; vp-&gt;speed() &lt;&lt; '\n';// see (3) below
    }
</pre>
    Now that <code >mass</code> is defined <code >virtual</code>, late binding is used:
    <ul>
    <li> at (1), <code >Car</code>'s mass is displayed;
    <li> at (2) <code >Truck</code>'s mass is displayed;
    <li> at (3) a syntax error is generated. The member
        <code >speed</code> is not a member of <code >Vehicle</code>, and hence not callable via
        a <code >Vehicle*</code>.
    </ul>
    The example illustrates that when a pointer to a class is used <em >only the
members of that class can be called</em>.  A member's <code >virtual</code> characteristic
only influences the type of binding (early vs. late), not the set of member
functions that is visible to the pointer.
<p>
Through virtual members derived classes may redefine the behavior performed by
functions called from base class members or from pointers or references to
base class objects. This redefinition of base class members by derived classes
is called <a name="an1777"></a><a name="an1778"></a><em >overriding members</em>.
<p>
<a name="VIRTDES"></a><a name="l284"></a>
<h2 >14.2: Virtual destructors</h2>
When an object ceases to exist the object's <a name="an1779"></a>destructor is called. Now
consider the following code fragment (cf. section <a href="cplusplus13.html#VehicleSystem">13.1</a>):
        <pre>
    Vehicle *vp = new Land{ 1000, 120 };

    delete vp;          // object destroyed
</pre>
    Here <code >delete</code> is applied to a base class pointer. As the base class
defines the available interface <code >delete vp</code> calls <code >~Vehicle</code> and <code >~Land</code>
remains out of sight. Assuming that <code >Land</code> allocates memory a
 <a name="an1780"></a>memory leak results. Freeing memory is not the only action destructors can
perform. In general they may perform any action that's necessary when an
object ceases to exist. But here none of the actions defined by <code >~Land</code> are
performed. Bad news....
<p>
In <strong >C++</strong> this problem is solved by
 <a name="an1781"></a><a name="an1782"></a> <em >virtual destructors</em>.  A
destructor can be declared <code >virtual</code>. When a base class destructor is
declared virtual then the destructor of the actual class pointed to by a base
class pointer <code >bp</code> is going to be called when <code >delete bp</code> is
executed. Thus, late binding is realized for destructors even though the
destructors of derived classes have unique names. Example:
        <pre>
    class Vehicle
    {
        public:
            virtual ~Vehicle();     // all derived class destructors are
                                    // now virtual as well.
    };
</pre>
    By declaring a virtual destructor, the above <code >delete</code> operation
(<code >delete vp</code>) correctly calls <code >Land</code>'s destructor, rather than
<code >Vehicle</code>'s destructor.
<p>
Once a destructor is called it performs as usual, whether or not it
is a virtual destructor. So, <code >~Land</code> first executes its own statements
and then calls <code >~Vehicle</code>. Thus, the above <code >delete vp</code> statement
uses late binding to call <code >~Vehicle</code> and from this point on the object
destruction proceeds as usual.
<p>
Destructors should always be defined <code >virtual</code> in classes designed as a
base class from which other classes are going to be derived. Often those
destructors themselves have no tasks to perform. In these cases the virtual
    <a name="an1783"></a> <a name="an1784"></a>
    destructor is given an empty body. For example, the definition of
<code >Vehicle::~Vehicle()</code> may be as simple as:
        <pre>
    Vehicle::~Vehicle()
    {}
</pre>
    Resist the temptation to define virtual destructors (even empty
destructors)
 <a name="an1785"></a> <a name="an1786"></a>inline as this complicates class
maintenance. Section <a href="cplusplus14.html#VTABLE">14.12</a> discusses the reason behind this
 <a name="an1787"></a>rule of thumb.
<p>
<a name="l285"></a>
<h2 >14.3: Pure virtual functions</h2>
The base class <code >Vehicle</code> is provided with its own concrete implementations
of its virtual members (<code >mass</code> and <code >setMass</code>).  However, virtual member
functions do not necessarily <em >have</em> to be implemented in base classes.
<p>
When the implementations of virtual members are omitted from base classes the
class imposes requirements upon derived classes. The derived classes are
required to provide the `missing implementations'.
<p>
This approach, in some languages (like <strong >C#, Delphi</strong>
 <a name="an1788"></a> and <strong >Java</strong>) known as an <a name="an1789"></a><em >interface</em>, defines a
 <a name="an1790"></a><em >protocol</em>. Derived classes <em >must</em> obey the protocol by implementing the
as yet not implemented members. If a class contains at least one member whose
implementation is missing no objects of that class can be defined.
<p>
Such incompletely defined classes are always base classes. They enforce a
protocol by merely declaring names, return values and arguments of some of
their members. These classes are call <a name="an1791"></a>
 <a name="an1792"></a><em >abstract classes</em> or <em >abstract base classes</em>.  Derived classes become
non-abtract classes by implementing the as yet not implemented members.
<p>
Abstract base classes are the foundation of many <em >design patterns</em>
 <a name="an1793"></a> (cf. <em >Gamma et al.</em> (1995))
 <a name="an1794"></a>, allowing the programmer to create highly
 <a name="an1795"></a><em >reusable software</em>. Some of these design patterns are covered by the
<strong >C++</strong> Annotations (e.g, the <a name="an1796"></a><em >Template Method</em> in section <a href="cplusplus24.html#FORK">24.2</a>), but for a
thorough discussion of design patterns the reader is referred to Gamma <em >et
al.</em>'s book.
<p>
Members that are merely declared in base classes are called
 <a name="an1797"></a><em >pure virtual functions</em>. A virtual member becomes a pure virtual member
by postfixing <a name="an1798"></a><code >= 0</code> to its declaration (i.e., by replacing the semicolon
ending its declaration by `<code >= 0;</code>'). Example:
        <pre>
    #include &lt;iosfwd&gt;
    class Base
    {
        public:
            virtual ~Base();
            virtual std::ostream &amp;insertInto(std::ostream &amp;out) const = 0;
    };
    inline std::ostream &amp;operator&lt;&lt;(std::ostream &amp;out, Base const &amp;base)
    {
        return base.insertInto(out);
    }
</pre>
    All classes derived from <code >Base</code> <em >must</em> implement the <code >insertInto</code>
member function, or their objects cannot be constructed. This is neat: all
objects of class types derived from <code >Base</code> can now always be inserted into
<a name="an1799"></a><code >ostream</code> objects.
<p>
Could the <a name="an1800"></a>virtual destructor of a base class ever be a pure virtual
function? The answer to this question is no. First of all, there is no need to
enforce the availability of destructors in derived classes as destructors are
provided by default (unless a destructor is declared with the <code >= delete</code>
attribute). Second, if it is a pure virtual member its implementation does not
exist. However, derived class destructors eventually call their base class
destructors. How could they call base class destructors if their
implementations are lacking? More about this in the next section.
<p>
Often, but not necessarily, pure virtual member functions are
<code >const</code> <a name="an1801"></a> member functions. This allows the
construction of constant derived class objects. In other situations this might
not be necessary (or realistic), and
 <a name="an1802"></a>non-constant member functions might be required. The general rule for
<code >const</code> member functions also applies to pure virtual functions: if the
member function alters the object's data members, it cannot be a <code >const</code>
member function.
<p>
Abstract base classes frequently don't have
 <a name="an1803"></a> data members.  However, once a base class
declares a pure virtual member it <em >must</em> be declared identically in derived
classes. If the implementation of a pure virtual function in a derived class
alters the derived class object's data, then <em >that</em> function cannot be
declared as a <code >const</code> member. Therefore, the author of an abstract base
class should carefully consider whether a pure virtual member function should
be a <code >const</code> member function or not.
<p>
<a name="l286"></a>
<h3 >14.3.1: Implementing pure virtual functions</h3>
    Pure virtual member functions may be implemented. To implement a pure virtual
    <a name="an1804"></a>
    <a name="an1805"></a>
 member function, provide it with its normal <code >= 0;</code> specification, but
implement it as well. Since the <code >= 0;</code> ends in a semicolon, the pure virtual
member is always at most a declaration in its class, but an implementation may
either be provided outside from its interface (maybe using <code >inline</code>).
<p>
Pure virtual member functions may be called from derived class objects or
from its class or derived class members by specifying the base class and scope
resolution operator together with the member to be called. Example:
<p>
<pre>
#include &lt;iostream&gt;

class Base
{
    public:
        virtual ~Base();
        virtual void pureimp() = 0;
};
Base::~Base()
{}
void Base::pureimp()
{
    std::cout &lt;&lt; "Base::pureimp() called\n";
}
class Derived: public Base
{
    public:
        virtual void pureimp();
};
inline void Derived::pureimp()
{
    Base::pureimp();
    std::cout &lt;&lt; "Derived::pureimp() called\n";
}
int main()
{
    Derived derived;

    derived.pureimp();
    derived.Base::pureimp();

    Derived *dp = &amp;derived;

    dp-&gt;pureimp();
    dp-&gt;Base::pureimp();
}
// Output:
//      Base::pureimp() called
//      Derived::pureimp() called
//      Base::pureimp() called
//      Base::pureimp() called
//      Derived::pureimp() called
//      Base::pureimp() called
</pre>
<p>
Implementing a pure virtual member has limited use. One could argue that
the pure virtual member function's implementation may be used to perform tasks
that can already be performed at the base class level. However, there is no
guarantee that the base class virtual member function is actually going to be
called.  Therefore base class specific tasks could as well be offered by a
separate member, without blurring the distinction between a member doing some
work and a pure virtual member enforcing a protocol.

<a name="FINAL"></a><a name="l287"></a>
<h2 >14.4: Explicit virtual overrides</h2>
Consider the following situations:
    <ul>
    <li> A class <code >Value</code> is a <em >value</em> class. It offers a copy constructor,
an overloaded assignment operator, maybe move operations, and a public,
non-virtual constructor. In section <a href="cplusplus14.html#INHERITWHY">14.7</a> it is argued that such
classes are not suited as base classes. New classes should not inherit from
<code >Value</code>. How to enforce this?
    <li> A polymorphic class <code >Base</code> defines a virtual member
<code >v_process(int32_t)</code>. A class derived from <code >Base</code> needs to override this
member, but the author mistakingly defined <code >v_proces(int32_t)</code>. How to
prevent such errors, breaking the polymorphic behavior of the derived class?
    <li> A class <code >Derived</code>, derived from a polymorphic <code >Base</code> class
overrides the member <code >Base::v_process</code>, but classes that are in turn derived
from <code >Derived</code> should no longer override <code >v_process</code>, but <em >may</em> override
other virtual members like <code >v_call</code> and <code >v_display</code>. How to enforce this
restricted polymorphic character for classes derived from <code >Derived</code>?
    </ul>
    Two special identifiers, <a name="an1806"></a><code >final</code> and <a name="an1807"></a><code >override</code> are used to realize
the above. These identifiers are special in the sense that they only require
their special meanings in specific contexts. Outside of this context they are
just plain identifiers, allowing the programmer to define a variable like
<code >bool final</code>.
<p>
The identifier <code >final</code> can be applied to class declarations to indicate
that the class cannot be used as a base class. E.g.:
        <pre>
    class Base1 final               // cannot be a base class
    {};
    class Derived1: public Base1    // ERR: Base1 is final
    {};

    class Base2                     // OK as base class
    {};
    class Derived2 final: public Base2  // OK, but Derived2 can't be
    {};                                 //     used as a base class
    class Derived: public Derived2      // ERR: Derived2 is final
    {};
</pre>
    The identifier <code >final</code> can also be added to virtual member
declarations. This indicates that those virtual members cannot be overridden
by derived classes. The restricted polymorphic character of a class, mentioned
above, can thus be realized as follows:
        <pre>
    class Base
    {
        virtual int v_process();    // define polymorphic behavior
        virtual int v_call();
        virtual int v_display();
    };
    class Derived: public Base      // Derived restricts polymorphism
    {                               // to v_call and v_display
        virtual int v_process() final;
    };
    class Derived2: public Derived
    {
        // int v_process();            No go: Derived:v_process is final
        virtual int v_display();    // OK to override
    };
</pre>
    To allow the compiler to detect typos, differences in parameter types, or
differences in member function modifiers (e.g., <code >const</code> vs. non-<code >const</code>)
the identifier <code >override</code> can (should) be appended to derived class members
overriding base class members. E.g.,
        <pre>
    class Base
    {
        virtual int v_process();
        virtual int v_call() const;
        virtual int v_display(std::ostream &amp;out);
    };
    class Derived: public Base
    {
        virtual int v_proces() override;    // ERR: v_proces != v_process
        virtual int v_call() override;      // ERR: not const
                                            // ERR: parameter types differ
        virtual int v_display(std::istream &amp;out) override;
    };
</pre>
<p>
<a name="MULTIPLEPOLYMORPH"></a><a name="l288"></a>
<h2 >14.5: Virtual functions and multiple inheritance</h2>
    In chapter <a href="cplusplus06.html#IOStreams">6</a> we encountered the class <code >fstream</code>, one class
offering features of <code >ifstream</code> and <code >ofstream</code>. In chapter
<a href="cplusplus13.html#INHERITANCE">13</a> we learned that a class may be derived from multiple base
classes. Such a derived class inherits the properties of all its base
classes. Polymorphism can also be used in combination with multiple
inheritance.
<p>
Consider what would happen if more than one `path' leads from the derived
class up to its (base) classes. This is illustrated in the next (fictitious)
example where a class <code >Derived</code> is doubly derived from <code >Base</code>:
        <pre>
    class Base
    {
        int d_field;
        public:
            void setfield(int val);
            int field() const;
    };
    inline void Base::setfield(int val)
    {
        d_field = val;
    }
    inline int Base::field() const
    {
        return d_field;
    }
    class Derived: public Base, public Base
    {};
</pre>
    Due to the double derivation, <code >Base</code>'s functionality now occurs twice in
<code >Derived</code>. This results in <a name="an1808"></a>ambiguity: when the function <code >setfield()</code> is
called for a <code >Derived</code> class object, which function will that be as there
are two of them? The scope resolution operator won't come to the rescue and so
the <strong >C++</strong> compiler cannot compile the above example and (correctly)
identifies an error.
<p>
The above code clearly duplicates its base class in the derivation, which can
of course easily be avoided by not doubly deriving from <code >Base</code> (or by using
composition (!)). But duplication of a base class can also occur through
 <a name="an1809"></a>nested inheritance, where an object is derived from, e.g., a <code >Car</code> and
from an <code >Air</code> (cf. section <a href="cplusplus13.html#VehicleSystem">13.1</a>). Such a class would be needed
to represent, e.g., a flying car&nbsp;(such as the one in James Bond
vs. the Man with the Golden Gun...). An <code >AirCar</code> would ultimately contain
two <code >Vehicles</code>, and hence two <code >mass</code> fields, two <code >setMass()</code>
functions and two <code >mass()</code> functions. Is this what we want?
<p>
<a name="l289"></a>
<h3 >14.5.1: Ambiguity in multiple inheritance</h3>
    Let's investigate closer why an <code >AirCar</code> introduces <a name="an1810"></a>ambiguity, when
derived from <code >Car</code> and <code >Air</code>.
    <ul>
    <li> An <code >AirCar</code> is a <code >Car</code>, hence a <code >Land</code>, and hence a
<code >Vehicle</code>.
    <li> However, an <code >AirCar</code> is also an <code >Air</code>, and hence a <code >Vehicle</code>.
    </ul>
    The duplication of <code >Vehicle</code> data is further illustrated in
Figure <a href="cplusplus14.html#ambiguity">15</a>.
    <p><a name="ambiguity"></a><figure >
<img src="polymorphism/ambiguity.gif" >
<figcaption >Figure 15: Duplication of a base class in multiple derivation.</figcaption>
</figure></p>

    The internal organization of an <code >AirCar</code> is shown in
Figure <a href="cplusplus14.html#InternalOrganization">16</a>
    <p><a name="InternalOrganization"></a><figure >
<img src="polymorphism/internal.gif" >
<figcaption >Figure 16: Internal organization of an <code >AirCar</code> object.</figcaption>
</figure></p>

    The <strong >C++</strong> compiler detects the ambiguity in an <code >AirCar</code> object,
and will therefore not  compile  statements like:
        <pre>
    AirCar jBond;
    cout &lt;&lt; jBond.mass() &lt;&lt; '\n';
</pre>
    Which member function <code >mass</code> to call cannot be determined by the
compiler but the programmer has two possibilities to resolve the ambiguity for
the compiler:
    <ul>
    <li> First, the function call where the ambiguity originates can be
modified. The ambiguity is resolved using the <a name="an1811"></a>scope resolution operator:
    <pre>
// let's hope that the mass is kept in the Car
// part of the object..
cout &lt;&lt; jBond.Car::mass() &lt;&lt; '\n';
</pre>
    The scope resolution operator and the class name are put right before
the name of the member function.
    <li> Second, a dedicated function <code >mass</code> could be created for
the class <code >AirCar</code>:
    <pre>
int AirCar::mass() const
{
    return Car::mass();
}
</pre>
    </ul>
    The second possibility is preferred as it does not require the compiler to
flag an error; nor does it require the programmer using the class
<code >AirCar</code> to take special precautions.
<p>
However, there exists a more elegant solution, discussed in the next
section.
<p>
<a name="VIRTUALBASE"></a><a name="l290"></a>
<h3 >14.5.2: Virtual base classes</h3>
        As illustrated in Figure <a href="cplusplus14.html#InternalOrganization">16</a>, an <code >AirCar</code> represents
<em >two</em> <code >Vehicle</code>s. This not only results in an <a name="an1812"></a>ambiguity about which
function to use to access the <code >mass</code> data, but it also defines two
<code >mass</code> fields in an <code >AirCar</code>. This is slightly redundant, since we can
assume that an <code >AirCar</code> has but one mass.
<p>
It is, however, possible to define an <code >AirCar</code> as a class consisting of
but one <code >Vehicle</code> and yet using multiple derivation.  This is realized by
defining the base classes that are multiply mentioned in a derived class's
inheritance tree as a
 <a name="an1813"></a> <a name="an1814"></a><em >virtual base class</em>.
<p>
For the class <code >AirCar</code> this implies a small change when deriving an
<code >AirCar</code> from <code >Land</code> and <code >Air</code> classes:
        <pre>
    class Land: virtual public Vehicle
    {
        // etc
    };
    class Car: public Land
    {
        // etc
    };
    class Air: virtual public Vehicle
    {
        // etc
    };
    class AirCar: public Car, public Air
    {
    };
</pre>
    Virtual derivation <a name="an1815"></a> ensures that a <code >Vehicle</code> is
only added once to a derived class. This means that the route along which a
<code >Vehicle</code> is added to an <code >AirCar</code> is no longer depending on its direct
base classes; we can only state that an <code >AirCar</code> is a <code >Vehicle</code>.  The
internal organization of an <code >AirCar</code> after virtual derivation is shown in
Figure <a href="cplusplus14.html#VirtualBaseClass">17</a>.
    <p><a name="VirtualBaseClass"></a><figure >
<img src="polymorphism/virtbase.gif" >
<figcaption >Figure 17: Internal organization of an <code >AirCar</code> object when the base
            classes are virtual.</figcaption>
</figure></p>

<p>
When a class <code >Third</code> inherits from a base class <code >Second</code> which in turn
inherits from a base class <code >First</code> then the <code >First</code> class constructor
called by the <code >Second</code> class constructor is also used when this <code >Second</code>
constructor is used when constructing a <code >Third</code> object. Example:
        <pre>
    class First
    {
        public:
            First(int x);
    };
    class Second: public First
    {
        public:
            Second(int x)
            :
                First(x)
            {}
    };
    class Third: public Second
    {
        public:
            Third(int x)
            :
                Second(x)           // calls First(x)
            {}
    };
</pre>
    The above no longer holds true when <code >Second</code> uses virtual derivation.
When <code >Second</code> uses virtual derivation its base class constructor is
<em >ignored</em> when <code >Second</code>'s constructor is called from <code >Third</code>. Instead
<code >Second</code> by default calls <code >First</code>'s default constructor. This is
illustrated by the next example:
        <pre>
    class First
    {
        public:
            First()
            {
                cout &lt;&lt; "First()\n";
            }
            First(int x);
    };
    class Second: public virtual First      // note: virtual
    {
        public:
            Second(int x)
            :
                First(x)
            {}
    };
    class Third: public Second
    {
        public:
            Third(int x)
            :
                Second(x)
            {}
    };
    int main()
    {
        Third third{ 3 };   // displays `First()'
    }
</pre>
    When constructing <code >Third</code> <code >First</code>'s default constructor is used by
default. <code >Third</code>'s constructor, however, may overrule this default behavior
by explicitly specifying the constructor to use. Since the <code >First</code> object
must be available before <code >Second</code> can be constructed it must be specified
first. To call <code >First(int)</code> when constructing <code >Third(int)</code> the latter
constructor can be defined as follows:
        <pre>
    class Third: public Second
    {
        public:
            Third(int x)
            :
                First(x),           // now First(int) is called.
                Second(x)
            {}
    };
</pre>
    This behavior may seem puzzling when simple linear inheritance is used but
it makes sense when multiple inheritance is used with base classes using
virtual inheritance. Consider <code >AirCar</code>: when <code >Air</code> and <code >Car</code> both
virtually inherit from <code >Vehicle</code> will <code >Air</code> and <code >Car</code> both initialize
the common <code >Vehicle</code> object? If so, which one is going to be called first?
What if <code >Air</code> and <code >Car</code> use different <code >Vehicle</code> constructors? All these
questions can be avoided by passing the responsibility for the initialization
of a common base class to the class eventually using the common base class
object. In the above example <code >Third</code>. Hence <code >Third</code> is provided an
opportunity to specify the constructor to use when initializing <code >First</code>.
<p>
Multiple inheritance may also be used to inherit from classes that do not all
use virtual inheritance. Assume we have two classes, <code >Derived1</code> and
<code >Derived2</code>, both (possibly virtually) derived from <code >Base</code>.
<p>
We now address the question which constructors will be called when calling a
constructor of the class <code >Final: public Derived1, public Derived2</code>.
<p>
To distinguish the involved constructors <code >Base1</code> indicates the <code >Base</code>
class constructor called as base class initializer for <code >Derived1</code> (and
analogously: <code >Base2</code> called from <code >Derived2</code>). A plain <code >Base</code>  indicates
<code >Base</code>'s  default constructor.
<p>
<code >Derived1</code> and <code >Derived2</code> indicate the base class initializers used when
constructing a <code >Final</code> object.
<p>
Now we're ready to distinguish the various cases when constructing an object
of the class <code >Final: public Derived1, public Derived2</code>:
        <ul>
        <li> classes:
                <pre>
Derived1: public Base
Derived2: public Base
</pre>
            <blockquote >This is normal, non virtual multiple derivation. The

</pre>
            </blockquote>
        <li> classes:

                constructor:
               <pre>
Base,
Base1,
Derived1,
Derived2
</pre>
               As only one class uses virtual derivation, <em >two</em> <code >Base</code>
                class objects remain available in the eventual <code >Final</code>
                class.

        <li> classes:

               <code >Derived1</code>'s base class constructor is ignored.  Instead,
                <code >Base</code> is called and it is called prior to any other
                constructor. Different from the first (non-virtual) case
                <code >Base</code> is now called, rather than <code >Base1</code>:
               <pre>
Base,
Derived1,

</pre>
            </blockquote>
        <li> classes:

                only <em >one</em> <code >Base</code> class object will be present in the

        </ul>
    Virtual derivation is, in contrast to virtual functions, a pure
<a name="an1816"></a>compile-time issue. Virtual inheritance merely defines
how the compiler defines a class's data organization and construction process.
<p>
<a name="l291"></a>
<h3 >14.5.3: When virtual derivation is not appropriate</h3>
    Virtual inheritance can be used to merge multiply occurring base
classes. However, situations may be encountered where multiple occurrences of
base classes is appropriate. Consider the definition of a <code >Truck</code> (cf.
section <a href="cplusplus13.html#Truck">13.5</a>):
        <pre>
    class Truck: public Car
    {
        int d_trailer_mass;

        public:
            Truck();
            Truck(int engine_mass, int sp, char const *nm,
                   int trailer_mass);

            void setMass(int engine_mass, int trailer_mass);
            int mass() const;
    };
    Truck::Truck(int engine_mass, int sp, char const *nm,
                  int trailer_mass)
    :
        Car(engine_mass, sp, nm)
    {
        d_trailer_mass = trailer_mass;
    }
    int Truck::mass() const
    {
        return                  // sum of:
            Car::mass() +    //   engine part plus
            trailer_mass;         //   the trailer
    }
</pre>
    This definition shows how a <code >Truck</code> object is constructed to contain two
mass fields: one via its derivation from <code >Car</code> and one via its own <code >int
d_trailer_mass</code> data member. Such a definition is of course valid, but it
could also be rewritten. We could derive a <code >Truck</code> from a <code >Car</code>
<em >and</em> from a <code >Vehicle</code>, thereby explicitly requesting the double presence
of a <code >Vehicle</code>; one for the mass of the engine and cabin, and one for the
mass of the trailer. A slight complication is that a class organization like
        <pre>
    class Truck: public Car, public Vehicle
</pre>
    is not accepted by the <strong >C++</strong> compiler. As a <code >Vehicle</code> is already part
of a <code >Car</code>, it is therefore not needed once again. This organzation may,
however be forced using a small trick. By creating an additional class
inheriting from <code >Vehicle</code> and deriving <code >Truck</code> from that additional class
rather than directly from <code >Vehicle</code> the problem is solved. Simply derive a
class <code >TrailerVeh</code> from <code >Vehicle</code>, and then <code >Truck</code> from <code >Car</code> and
<code >TrailerVeh</code>:
        <pre>
    class TrailerVeh: public Vehicle
    {
        public:
            TrailerVeh(int mass)
            :
                Vehicle(mass)
            {}
    };
    class Truck: public Car, public TrailerVeh
    {
        public:
            Truck();
            Truck(int engine_mass, int sp, char const *nm, int trailer_mass);
            void setMass(int engine_mass, int trailer_mass);

<h2 >14.6: Run-time type identification</h2>
<strong >C++</strong> offers two ways to <a name="an1817"></a> retrieve type of
objects and expressions ar run-time. The possibilities of <strong >C++</strong>'s run-time
type identification are limited compared to languages like
 <a name="an1818"></a> <strong >Java</strong>. Usually
    <a name="an1819"></a>static type checking and <a name="an1820"></a>static type identification is used in
<strong >C++</strong>. Static type checking is possibly safer and certainly more efficient
than run-time type identification and should therefore be preferred over
run-time type identification. But situations exist where run-time type
identification is appropriate. <strong >C++</strong> offers run-time type identification
through the <a name="an1821"></a><em >dynamic cast</em> and <a name="an1822"></a><code >typeid</code> operators.
    <ul>
    <li> A <code >dynamic_cast</code>  is used  to convert a base
class <a name="an1823"></a> pointer or reference to a
derived class pointer or reference. This is also known as <a name="an1824"></a><em >down-casting</em>.
        <li> The <a name="an1825"></a><code >typeid</code> operator returns the actual type of an expression.
            <a name="an1826"></a>
    </ul>
    These operators can be used with objects of classes having at least one
virtual member function.
<p>
<a name="DYNAMICCAST"></a><a name="l293"></a>
<h3 >14.6.1: The dynamic_cast operator</h3>
        The <a name="an1827"></a><code >dynamic_cast&lt;&gt;</code> operator is used to convert a base
class pointer or <a name="an1828"></a> reference to,
respectively, a <a name="an1829"></a>derived class pointer or reference. This is also called
<a name="an1830"></a><em >down-casting</em> as direction of the cast is <em >down</em> the inheritance tree.
<p>
A dynamic cast's actions are determined <a name="an1831"></a>run-time; it can only be used if
the base class declares at least one virtual member function. For the dynamic
cast to succeed, the destination class's <code >Vtable</code> must be equal to the
<code >Vtable</code> to which the dynamic cast's argument refers to, lest the cast fails
and returns 0 (if a dynamic cast of a pointer was requested) or throws a
<code >std::bad_cast</code> exception (if a dynamic cast of a reference was requested).
<p>
In the following example a pointer to the class <code >Derived</code> is obtained from
the <code >Base</code> class pointer <code >bp</code>:
        <pre>
    class Base
    {
        public:
            virtual ~Base();
    };
    class Derived: public Base
    {
        public:
            char const *toString();
    };
    inline char const *Derived::toString()
    {
        return "Derived object";
    }
    int main()
    {
        Base *bp;
        Derived *dp,
        Derived d;

        bp = &amp;d;

        dp = dynamic_cast&lt;Derived *&gt;(bp);

        if (dp)
            cout &lt;&lt; dp-&gt;toString() &lt;&lt; '\n';
        else
            cout &lt;&lt; "dynamic cast conversion failed\n";
    }
</pre>
    In the condition of the above <code >if</code> statement the success of the dynamic
cast is verified. This verification is performed at <em >run-time</em>, as the
actual class of the objects to which the pointer points is only known by then.
<p>
If a base class pointer is provided, the dynamic cast operator returns 0 on
failure and a pointer to the requested derived class on success.
<p>
Assume a <code >vector&lt;Base *&gt;</code> is used. The pointers of such a vector may
point to objects of various classes, all derived from <code >Base</code>. A dynamic cast
returns a pointer to the specified class if the base class pointer indeed
points to an object of the specified class and returns 0 otherwise.
<p>
We could determine the actual class of an object a pointer points to by
performing a series of checks to find the derived class to which a base class
pointer points. Example:
        <pre>
    class Base
    {
        public:
            virtual ~Base();
    };
    class Derived1: public Base;
    class Derived2: public Base;

    int main()
    {
        vector&lt;Base *&gt; vb(initializeBase());

        Base *bp = vb.front();

        if (dynamic_cast&lt;Derived1 *&gt;(bp))
            cout &lt;&lt; "bp points to a Derived1 class object\n";
        else if (dynamic_cast&lt;Derived2 *&gt;(bp))
            cout &lt;&lt; "bp points to a Derived2 class object\n";
    }
</pre>
<p>
Alternatively, a reference to a base class object may be available. In
this case the <code >dynamic_cast</code> operator throws an <a name="an1832"></a>exception if the down
casting fails. Example:
        <pre>
    #include &lt;iostream&gt;
    #include &lt;typeinfo&gt;

    class Base
    {
        public:
            virtual ~Base();
            virtual char const *toString();
    };
    inline char const *Base::toString()
    {
        return "Base::toString() called";
    }
    class Derived1: public Base
    {};
    class Derived2: public Base
    {};

    Base::~Base()
    {}
    void process(Base &amp;b)
    {
        try
        {
            std::cout &lt;&lt; dynamic_cast&lt;Derived1 &amp;&gt;(b).toString() &lt;&lt; '\n';
        }
        catch (std::bad_cast)
        {}
        try
        {
            std::cout &lt;&lt; dynamic_cast&lt;Derived2 &amp;&gt;(b).toString() &lt;&lt; '\n';
        }
        catch (std::bad_cast)
        {
            std::cout &lt;&lt; "Bad cast to Derived2\n";
        }
    }
    int main()
    {
        Derived1 d;
        process(d);
    }
    /*
        Generated output:

        Base::toString() called
        Bad cast to Derived2
    */
</pre>
    In this example the value <code >std::bad_cast</code> <a name="an1833"></a> is used. A
<code >std::bad_cast</code> exception is thrown if the dynamic cast of a reference to a
derived class object fails.
<p>
Note the form of the <code >catch</code> clause: <code >bad_cast</code> is the name of a type.
Section <a href="cplusplus17.html#EMPTYENUM">17.4.1</a> describes how  such a type can be defined.
<p>
The dynamic cast operator is a useful tool when an existing base class cannot
or should not be modified (e.g., when the sources are not available), and a
derived class may be modified instead. Code receiving a base class pointer or
reference may then perform a dynamic cast to the derived class to access the
derived class's functionality.
<p>
You may wonder in what way the behavior of the <code >dynamic_cast</code> differs from
that of the <code >static_cast</code>.
<p>
When the <code >static_cast</code> is used, we tell the compiler that it must convert a
pointer or reference to its expression type to a pointer or reference of its
destination type. This holds true whether the base class declares virtual
members or not. Consequently, all the <code >static_cast</code>'s actions can be
determined by the compiler, and the following compiles fine:
        <pre>
    class Base
    {
        // maybe or not virtual members
    };
    class Derived1: public Base
    {};
    class Derived2: public Base
    {};

    int main()
    {
        Derived1 derived1;
        Base *bp = &amp;derived1;

        Derived1 &amp;d1ref = static_cast&lt;Derived1 &amp;&gt;(*bp);
        Derived2 &amp;d2ref = static_cast&lt;Derived2 &amp;&gt;(*bp);
    }
</pre>
    Pay attention to the second <code >static_cast</code>: here the <code >Base</code> class
object is cast to a <code >Derived2</code> class reference. The compiler has no problems
with this, as <code >Base</code> and <code >Derived2</code> are related by inheritance.
<p>
Semantically, however, it makes no sense as <code >bp</code> in fact points to a
<code >Derived1</code> class object. This is detected by a <code >dynamic_cast</code>.  A
<code >dynamic_cast</code>, like the <code >static_cast</code>, converts related pointer or
reference types, but the <code >dynamic_cast</code> provides a run-time safeguard. The
dynamic cast fails when the requested type doesn't match the actual type of
the object we're pointing at. In addition, the <code >dynamic_cast</code>'s use is much
more restricted than the <code >static_cast</code>'s use, as the <code >dynamic_cast</code> can
only be used for downcasting to derived classes having virtual members.
<p>
In the end a dynamic cast is a cast, and casts should be avoided whenever
possible. When the need for dynamic casting arises ask yourself whether the
base class has correctly been designed. In situations where code expects a
base class reference or pointer the base class interface should be all that is
required and using a dynamic cast should not be necessary. Maybe the base
class's virtual interface can be modified so as to prevent the use of dynamic
casts. Start frowning when encountering code using dynamic casts. When using
dynamic casts in your own code always properly document why the dynamic cast
was appropriately used and was not avoided.
<p>
<a name="TYPEID"></a><a name="l294"></a>
<h3 >14.6.2: The `typeid' operator</h3>
        As with the <a name="an1834"></a><code >dynamic_cast</code> operator, <a name="an1835"></a><code >typeid</code> is usually applied to
references to base class objects that refer to derived class
objects. <code >Typeid</code> should only be used with base classes offering virtual
members. 
<p>
Before using <code >typeid</code> the <a name="an1836"></a><code >&lt;typeinfo&gt;</code> header file must be included.
<p>
The <code >typeid</code> operator returns an object of type <code >type_info</code>.
Different compilers may offer different implementations of the class
<code >type_info</code>, but at the very least <code >typeid</code> must offer the following
interface:
        <pre>
    class type_info
    {
        public:
            virtual ~type_info();
            int operator==(type_info const &amp;other) const;
            int operator!=(type_info const &amp;other) const;
            bool before(type_info const &amp;rhs) const;
            char const *name() const;
        private:
            type_info(type_info const &amp;other);
            type_info &amp;operator=(type_info const &amp;other);
    };
</pre>
    Note that this class has a private copy constructor and a private
overloaded assignment operator. This prevents code from  constructing
<code >type_info</code> objects and prevents code from assigning <code >type_info</code> objects
to each other. Instead, <code >type_info</code> objects are
constructed and returned by the <code >typeid</code> operator.
<p>
If the <code >typeid</code> operator is passed a base class reference it is able to
return the actual name of the type the reference refers to. Example:
        <pre>
    class Base;
    class Derived: public Base;

    Derived d;
    Base    &amp;br = d;

    cout &lt;&lt; typeid(br).name() &lt;&lt; '\n';
</pre>
    In this example the <code >typeid</code> operator is given a base class reference.
It prints the text ``<code >Derived</code>'', being the <a name="an1837"></a>class name of the class
<code >br</code> actually refers to. If <code >Base</code> does not contain virtual functions, the
text ``<code >Base</code>'' is printed.
<p>
The <code >typeid</code> operator can be used to determine the name of the actual
type of <a name="an1838"></a> expressions, not just of class type
objects. For example:
        <pre>
    cout &lt;&lt; typeid(12).name() &lt;&lt; '\n';     // prints:  int
    cout &lt;&lt; typeid(12.23).name() &lt;&lt; '\n';  // prints:  double
</pre>
    Note, however, that the above example is suggestive at most. It <em >may</em>
print <code >int</code> and <code >double</code>, but this is not necessarily the case. If
portability is required, make sure no tests against these static, built-in
text-strings are required. Check out what your compiler produces in case of
doubt.
<p>
In situations where the <code >typeid</code> operator is applied to
determine the type of a derived class, a base class <em >reference</em>
        <a name="an1839"></a>
    should be used as the argument of the <code >typeid</code> operator. Consider
the following example:
        <pre>
    class Base;     // contains at least one virtual function
    class Derived: public Base;

    Base *bp = new Derived;     // base class pointer to derived object

    if (typeid(bp) == typeid(Derived *))    // 1: false
        ...
    if (typeid(bp) == typeid(Base *))       // 2: true
        ...
    if (typeid(bp) == typeid(Derived))      // 3: false
        ...
    if (typeid(bp) == typeid(Base))         // 4: false
        ...
    if (typeid(*bp) == typeid(Derived))     // 5: true
        ...
    if (typeid(*bp) == typeid(Base))        // 6: false
        ...

    Base &amp;br = *bp;

    if (typeid(br) == typeid(Derived))      // 7: true
        ...
    if (typeid(br) == typeid(Base))         // 8: false
        ...
</pre>
    Here, <code >(1)</code> returns <code >false</code> as a <code >Base *</code> is not a <code >Derived
*</code>. <code >(2)</code> returns <code >true</code>, as the two pointer types are the same, <code >(3)</code>
and <code >(4)</code> return <code >false</code> as pointers to objects are not the objects
themselves.
<p>
On the other hand, if <code >*bp</code> is used in the above expressions, then
<code >(1)</code> and <code >(2)</code> return <code >false</code> as an object (or reference to an object)
is not a pointer to an object, whereas <code >(5)</code> now returns <code >true</code>: <code >*bp</code>
actually refers to a <code >Derived</code> class object, and <code >typeid(*bp)</code> returns
<code >typeid(Derived)</code>.  A similar result is obtained if a base class reference
is used: <code >7</code> returning <code >true</code> and <code >8</code> returning <code >false</code>.
<p>
The <code >type_info::before(type_info const &amp;rhs)</code> member is used to
determine the <a name="an1840"></a><em >collating order</em> of classes. This is useful when comparing
two <em >types</em> for equality.  The function returns a nonzero value if <code >*this</code>
precedes <code >rhs</code> in the hierarchy or collating order of the used types. When a
derived class is compared to its base class the comparison returns 0,
otherwise a non-zero value. E.g.:
        <pre>
    cout &lt;&lt; typeid(ifstream).before(typeid(istream)) &lt;&lt; '\n' &lt;&lt; // not 0
            typeid(istream).before(typeid(ifstream)) &lt;&lt; '\n';   // 0
</pre>
    With built-in types the implementor may implement that non-0 is returned
when a `wider' type is compared to a `smaller' type and 0 otherwise:
        <pre>
    cout &lt;&lt; typeid(double).before(typeid(int)) &lt;&lt; '\n' &lt;&lt;   // not 0
            typeid(int).before(typeid(double)) &lt;&lt; '\n';     // 0
</pre>
    When two equal types are compared, 0 is returned:
        <pre>
    cout &lt;&lt; typeid(ifstream).before(typeid(ifstream)) &lt;&lt; '\n';   // 0
</pre>
    When a <code >0</code>-pointer is passed to the <code >operator typeid</code> a <a name="an1841"></a><code >bad_typeid</code>
exception is thrown.
<p>
<a name="INHERITWHY"></a><a name="l295"></a>
<h2 >14.7: Inheritance: when to use to achieve what?</h2>
Inheritance should not be applied automatically and thoughtlessly. Often
composition can be used instead, improving on a class's design by reducing
coupling. When inheritance is used <em >public</em> inheritance should not
automatically be used but the type of inheritance that is selected should
match the programmer's intent.
<p>
We've seen that polymorphic classes on the one hand offer interface members
defining the functionality that can be requested of base classes and on the
other hand offer virtual members that can be overridden. One of the signs of
good class design is that member functions are designed according to the
principle of `one function, one task'. In the current context: a class member
should either be a member of the class's public or protected interface or it
should be available as a virtual member for reimplementation by derived
classes. Often this boils down to virtual members that are defined in the base
class's <em >private</em> section. Those functions shouldn't be called by code using
the base class, but they exist to be overridden by derived classes using
polymorphism to redefine the base class's behavior.
<p>
The underlying principle was mentioned before in the introductory paragraph
of this chapter: according to the <a name="an1842"></a><em >Liskov Substitution Principle</em>
(<a name="an1843"></a><em >LSP</em>) an <a name="an1844"></a><em >is-a</em> relationship between classes (indicating that a
derived class object <em >is a</em> base class object) implies that a derived class
object may be used in code expecting a base class object.
<p>
In this case inheritance is used <em >not</em> to let the derived class use the
facilities already implemented by the base class but to reuse the base class
polymorphically by reimplementing the base class's virtual members in the
derived class.
<p>
In this section we'll discuss the reasons for using inheritance. Why should
inheritance (not) be used? If it is used what do we try to accomplish by it?
<p>
Inheritance often competes with composition. Consider the following two
alternative class designs:
        <pre>
    class Derived: public Base
    { ... };

    class Composed
    {
        Base d_base;
        ...
    };
</pre>
    Why and when prefer <code >Derived</code> over <code >Composed</code> and vice versa? What
kind of inheritance should be used when designing the class <code >Derived</code>?
    <ul>
    <li> Since <code >Composed</code> and <code >Derived</code> are offered as alternatives we are
        looking at the design of a class (<code >Derived</code> or <code >Composed</code>) that
        <a name="an1845"></a><em >is-implemented-in-terms-of</em> another class.
    <li> Since <code >Composed</code> does itself not make <code >Base</code>'s interface
        available, <code >Derived</code> shouldn't do so either. The underlying
        principle is that <a name="an1846"></a><em >private inheritance</em> should be used when
        deriving a classs <code >Derived</code> from <code >Base</code> where <code >Derived</code>
        is-implemented-in-terms-of <code >Base</code>.
    <li> Should we use inheritance or composition? Here are some arguments:
        <ul>
        <li> In general terms composition results in looser coupling and
            should therefore be preferred over inheritance.
        <li> Composition allows us to define classes having multiple members
            of the same type (think about a class having multiple
            <code >std::string</code> members) which can not be realized using
            inheritance.
        <li> Composition allows us to separate the class's interface from its
            implementation. This allows us to modify the class's data
            organization without the need to recompile code using our
            class. This is also known as the <a name="an1847"></a><em >bridge design pattern</em> or the
            <a name="an1848"></a><em >compiler firewall</em> or <a name="an1849"></a><em >pimpl</em> (pointer to the
            implementation) idiom.
        <li> If <code >Base</code> offers members in its <em >protected</em> interface that
            must be used when implementing <code >Derived</code> inheritance must also
            be used. Again: since we're implementing-in-terms-of the
            inheritance type should be <code >private</code>.
        <li> Protected inheritance may be considered when the derived class
            (<code >D</code>) itself is intended as a base class that should only make
            the members of its own base class (<code >B</code>) available to classes
            that are derived from it (i.e., <code >D</code>).
        </ul>
    </ul>
<p>
Private inheritance should also be used when a derived class is-a certain
type of base class, but in order to initialize that base class an object of
another class type must be available. Example: a new <code >istream</code> class-type
(say: a stream <code >IRandStream</code> from which random numbers can be extracted) is
derived from <code >std::istream</code>.  Although an <code >istream</code> can be constructed
empty (receiving its <code >streambuf</code> later using its <code >rdbuf</code> member), it is
clearly preferable to initialize the <code >istream</code> base class right away.
<p>
Assuming that a <code >Randbuffer: public std::streambuf</code> has been created for
generating random numbers then <code >IRandStream</code> can be derived from
<code >Randbuffer</code> and <code >std::istream</code>. That way the <code >istream</code> base class can
be initialized using the <code >Randbuffer</code> base class.
<p>
As a <code >RandStream</code> is definitely not a <code >Randbuffer</code> <em >public</em> inheritance
is <em >not</em> appropriate. In this case <code >IRandStream</code>
is-implemented-in-terms-of a <code >Randbuffer</code> and so <em >private</em> inheritance
should be used.
<p>
<code >IRandStream</code>'s class interface should therefore start like this:
        <pre>
    class IRandStream: private Randbuffer, public std::istream
    {
        public:
            IRandStream(int lowest, int highest)    // defines the range
            :
                Randbuffer(lowest, highest),
                std::istream(this)                  // passes &amp;Randbuffer
            {}
        ...
    };
</pre>
<p>
Public inheritance should be reserved for classes for which the LSP holds
true. In those cases the derived classes can always be used instead of the
base class from which they derive by code merely using base class references,
pointers or members (I.e., conceptually the derived class <a name="an1850"></a><em >is-a</em> base
class). This most often applies to classes derived from base classes offering
virtual members. To separate the user interface from the redefinable interface
the base class's public interface should <em >not</em> contain virtual members
(except for the virtual destructor) and the virtual members should all be in
the base class's private section. Such virtual members can still be overridden
by derived classes (this should not come as a surprise, considering how
polymorphism is implemented) and this design offers the base class full
control over the context in which the redefined members are used. Often the
public interface merely calls a virtual member, but those members can always
be redefined to perform additional duties.
<p>
The prototypical form of a <a name="an1851"></a> base class therefore
looks like this:
        <pre>
    class Base
    {
        public:
            virtual ~Base()
            void process();             // calls virtual members (e.g.,
                                        // v_process)
        private:
            virtual void v_process();   // overridden by derived classes
    };

    Alternatively a base class may offer a non-virtual destructor, which
should then be protected. It shouldn't be public to prevent deleting objects
through their base class pointers (in which case virtual destructors should be
used). It should be protected to allow derived class destructors to call their
base class destructors. Such base classes should, for the same reasons, have
non-public constructors and overloaded assignment operators.

<h2 >14.8: The `streambuf' class</h2>
The class <a name="an1852"></a><code >std::streambuf</code> receives the character sequences
processed by streams and defines the interface between stream objects and
devices (like a file on disk). A <code >streambuf</code> object is usually not directly
constructed, but usually it is used as base class of some derived class
implementing the communication with some concrete device.
<p>
The primary reason for existence of the class <code >streambuf</code> is to decouple
the <code >stream</code> classes from the devices they operate upon. The rationale here
is to add an extra layer between the classes allowing us to communicate with
devices and the devices themselves. This implements a <a name="an1853"></a><em >chain of command</em>
which is seen regularly in software design.
<p>
The <em >chain of command</em> is considered a generic pattern when designing
 <a name="an1854"></a>reusable software, encountered also in, e.g., the
 <a name="an1855"></a>TCP/IP stack.
<p>
A <code >streambuf</code> can be considered yet another example of the chain of
command pattern. Here the program talks to <code >stream</code> objects, which in turn
forward their requests to <code >streambuf</code> objects, which in turn communicate
with the devices. Thus, as we will see shortly, we are able to do in
user-software what had to be done via (expensive) system calls before.
<p>
The class <code >streambuf</code> has no public constructor, but does make available
several public member functions. In addition to these public member functions,
several member functions are only available to classes derived from
<code >streambuf</code>.  In section <a href="cplusplus14.html#FILEBUF">14.8.2</a> a predefined specialization of the
class <code >streambuf</code> is introduced. All public members of <code >streambuf</code>
discussed here are <em >also</em> available in <code >filebuf</code>.
<p>
The next section shows the <code >streambuf</code> members that may be overridden
when deriving classes from <code >streambuf</code>. Chapter <a href="cplusplus24.html#CONCRETE">24</a> offers
concrete examples of classes derived from <code >streambuf</code>.
<p>
The class <code >streambuf</code> is used by streams performing input operations and
by streams performing output operations and their member functions can be
ordered likewise. The type <code >std::streamsize</code><a name="an1856"></a> used below may,
for all practical purposes, be considered equal to the type <code >size_t</code>.
<p>
<a name="STRBUFLABEL"></a>
    <a name="an1857"></a><a name="an1858"></a>
    When inserting information into <code >ostream</code> objects the information is
eventually passed on to the <code >ostream</code>'s <code >streambuf</code>. The <code >streambuf</code> may
decide to throw an exception. However, this exception does not leave the
<code >ostream</code> using the <code >streambuf</code>. Rather, the exception is caught by the
<code >ostream</code>, which sets its <code >ios::bad_bit</code>. Exceptions thrown by
manipulators which are inserted into <code >ostream</code> objects are <em >not</em> caught by
the <code >ostream</code> objects.

<h3 >14.8.1: Protected `streambuf' members</h3>
    The <em >protected</em> members of the class <code >streambuf</code> are important for
understanding and using <code >streambuf</code> objects. Although there are both
protected <a name="an1879"></a>data members and protected member functions
    <a name="an1880"></a> defined in the <code >class streambuf</code> the protected
<em >data</em> members are not mentioned here as using them would violate the
principle of <a name="an1881"></a><em >data hiding</em>. As <code >streambuf</code>'s set of member functions is
quite extensive, it is hardly ever necessary to use its data members
directly. The following subsections do not even list all protected member
functions but only those are covered that are useful for constructing
specializations.
<p>
<code >Streambuf</code> objects control a buffer, used for input and/or output, for
which begin-, actual- and end-pointers have been defined, as depicted in
figure <a href="cplusplus14.html#SBBUFFERS">18</a>.

<code >Streambuf</code> offers two protected constructors:
    <ul>
    <li><code >streambuf::streambuf()</code>:<blockquote >Default (protected) constructor of the <code >class streambuf</code>.</blockquote>
    <li><code >streambuf::streambuf(streambuf const &amp;rhs)</code>:<blockquote >(Protected) copy constructor of the <code >class streambuf</code>. Note that

note that these are <em >not</em> shared pointers, but only `raw copies'.</blockquote>
    </ul>
<p>
<a name="l298"></a>
<h4>14.8.1.1: Protected members for input operations</h4>
        Several protected member functions are available for input operations. The
member functions marked <code >virtual</code> may of course be redefined in derived
classes:
    <ul>
    <li><a name="an1882"></a><code >char *eback()</code>:<blockquote ><code >Streambuf</code> maintains three pointers controlling its input buffer:
        <code >eback</code> points to the `end of the putback' area: characters can
        safely be put back up to this position. See also figure
        <a href="cplusplus14.html#SBBUFFERS">18</a>. <code >Eback</code> points to the <em >beginning</em> of the input
        buffer.</blockquote>
    <li><a name="an1883"></a><code >char *egptr()</code>:<blockquote ><code >Egptr</code> points just beyond the last character that can be retrieved
        from the input buffer. See also figure <a href="cplusplus14.html#SBBUFFERS">18</a>. If <code >gptr</code>
        equals <code >egptr</code> the buffer must be refilled. This should be
        implemented by calling <code >underflow</code>, see below.</blockquote>
    <li><a name="an1884"></a><code >void gbump(int n)</code>:<blockquote >The object's <code >gptr</code> (see below) is advanced over  <code >n</code> positions.</blockquote>
    <li><a name="an1885"></a><code >char *gptr()</code>:<blockquote ><code >Gptr</code> points to the next character to be
        retrieved from the object's input buffer. See also figure
        <a href="cplusplus14.html#SBBUFFERS">18</a>.</blockquote>
    <li><a name="an1886"></a><code >virtual int pbackfail(int c)</code>:<blockquote >This member function may be overridden by derived classes to do
        something intelligent when putting back character <code >c</code> fails. One
        might consider restoring the old read pointer when input buffer's
        begin has been reached. This member function is called when ungetting
        or putting back a character fails. In particular, it is called when
            <ul>
            <li><code >gptr() == 0</code>: no buffering used,
            <li><code >gptr() == eback()</code>: no more room to push back,
            <li><code >*gptr() != c</code>: a different character than the next character
                to be read must be pushed back.
            </ul>
       If <code >c == endOfFile()</code> then the input device must be reset by one
        character position. Otherwise <code >c</code> must be prepended to the
        characters to be read. The function should return <code >EOF</code> on
        failure. Otherwise 0 can be returned.</blockquote>
    <li><a name="an1887"></a><code >void setg(char *beg, char *next, char *beyond)</code>:<blockquote >Initializes an input buffer. <code >beg</code> points to the beginning of the
        input area, <code >next</code> points to the next character to be retrieved, and
        <code >beyond</code> points to the location just beyond the input buffer's last
        character. Usually <code >next</code> is at least <code >beg + 1</code>, to allow for a
        put back operation. No input buffering is used when this member is
        called as <code >setg(0, 0, 0)</code>. See also the member <code >uflow</code>, below.</blockquote>
    <li><a name="an1888"></a><code >virtual streamsize showmanyc()</code>:<blockquote >(Pronounce: s-how-many-c) This member function may be overridden by
        derived classes. It must return a guaranteed lower bound on the number
        of characters that can be read from the device before <code >uflow</code> or
        <code >underflow</code> returns <code >EOF</code>. By default 0 is returned (meaning
        no or some characters are returned before the latter two functions
        return <code >EOF</code>). When a positive value is returned then the next
        call of <code >u(nder)flow</code> does not return <code >EOF</code>.</blockquote>
    <li><a name="an1889"></a><code >virtual int uflow()</code>:<blockquote >This member function may be overridden by derived classes to reload an
        input buffer with fresh characters. Its default implementation is to
        call <code >underflow</code> (see below). If <code >underflow()</code> fails, <code >EOF</code>
        is returned.  Otherwise, the next available character is returned as
        <code >static_cast&lt;unsigned char&gt;(*gptr())</code> following a
        <code >gbump(-1)</code>. <code >Uflow</code> also moves the pending character that is
        returned to the backup sequence. This is different from
        <code >underflow()</code>, which merely returns the next available character,
        but does not alter the input pointer positions.
<p>
When <em >no</em> input buffering is required this function,
        rather than <code >underflow</code>, can be overridden to produce the next
        available character from the device to read from.</blockquote>
    <li><a name="an1890"></a><code >virtual int underflow()</code>:<blockquote >This member function may be overridden by derived classes to read
        another character from the device. The default implementation is to
        return <code >EOF</code>.
<p>
It is called when
            <ul>
            <li> there is no input buffer (<code >eback() == 0</code>)
            <li><code >gptr() &gt;= egptr()</code>: the input buffer is exhausted.
            </ul>
<p>
Often, when buffering is used, the complete buffer
        is not refreshed as this would make it impossible to put back
        characters immediately following a reload. Instead, buffers are often
        refreshed in halves. This system is called a <a name="an1891"></a><em >split buffer</em>.
<p>
Classes derived from <code >streambuf</code> for reading normally at least
        override <code >underflow</code>. The prototypical example of an overridden
        <code >underflow</code> function looks like this:
            <pre>
int underflow()
{
    if (not refillTheBuffer())  // assume a member d_buffer is available
        return EOF;
                                // reset the input buffer pointers
    setg(d_buffer, d_buffer, d_buffer + d_nCharsRead);

                                // return the next available character
                                // (the cast is used to prevent
                                // misinterpretations of 0xff characters
                                // as EOF)
    return static_cast&lt;unsigned char&gt;(*gptr());
}
</pre>
        </blockquote>
    <li><a name="an1892"></a><code >virtual streamsize xsgetn(char *buffer, streamsize n)</code>:<blockquote >This member function may be overridden by derived classes to retrieve
        at once <code >n</code> characters from the input device. The default
        implementation is to call <code >sbumpc</code> for every single character
        meaning that by default this member (eventually) calls <code >underflow</code>
        for every single character. The function returns the actual number of
        characters read or <code >EOF</code>. Once <code >EOF</code> is returned the
        <code >streambuf</code> stops reading the device.</blockquote>
    </ul>
<p>
<a name="l299"></a>
<h4>14.8.1.2: Protected members for output operations</h4>
        The following  protected members are available for output
operations. Again, some members may be overridden by derived classes:
    <ul>
    <li><a name="an1893"></a><code >virtual int overflow(int c)</code>:<blockquote >This member function may be overridden by derived classes to flush the
        characters currently stored in the output buffer to the output device,
        and then to reset the output buffer pointers so as to represent an
        empty buffer. Its parameter <code >c</code> is initialized to the next character
        to be processed. If no output buffering is used <code >overflow</code> is called
        for every single character that is written to the <code >streambuf</code>
        object. No output buffering is accomplished by setting the buffer
        pointers (using, <code >setp</code>, see below) to 0. The
        <a name="an1894"></a>default implementation returns <code >EOF</code>, indicating that no
        characters can be written to the device.
<p>
Classes derived from <code >streambuf</code> for writing normally at least
        override <code >overflow</code>. The prototypical example of an overridden
        <code >overflow</code> function looks like this:
            <pre>
int OFdStreambuf::overflow(int c)
{
    sync();                             // flush the buffer
    if (c != EOF)                       // write a character?
    {

        pbump(1);                       // advance the buffer's pointer

    <li><a name="an1909"></a><code >virtual int sync()</code>:<blockquote >This member function may be overridden by derived classes to flush the
        output buffer to the output device or to reset the input device just
        beyond the position of the character that was returned last. It
        returns 0 on success, -1 on failure. The default implementation (not
        using a buffer) is to return 0, indicating successful syncing. This
        member is used to ensure that any characters that are still buffered
        are written to the device or to put unconsumed characters back to the
        device when the <code >streambuf</code> object ceases to exist.</blockquote>

<h4>14.8.1.4: Deriving classes from `streambuf'</h4>
            When classes are derived from <code >streambuf</code> at least <code >underflow</code> should
be overridden by classes intending to read information from devices, and
<code >overflow</code> should be overridden by classes intending to write information to
devices. Several examples of classes derived from <code >streambuf</code> are provided
in chapter <a href="cplusplus24.html#CONCRETE">24</a>.
<p>
<code >Fstream</code> class type objects use a combined input/output buffer,
resulting from <code >istream</code> and <code >ostream</code> being virtually derived from
<code >ios</code>, which class defines a <code >streambuf</code>. To construct a class
supporting both input and output using separate buffers, the <code >streambuf</code>
itself may define two buffers. When <code >seekoff</code> is called for reading, a
<code >mode</code> parameter can be set to <code >ios::in</code>, otherwise to <code >ios::out</code>. Thus
the derived class knows whether it should access the <code >read</code> buffer or the
<code >write</code> buffer. Of course, <code >underflow</code> and <code >overflow</code> do not have to
inspect the mode flag as they by implication know on which buffer they should
operate.
<p>
<a name="FILEBUF"></a><a name="l302"></a>
<h3 >14.8.2: The class `filebuf'</h3>
    The <code >class</code> <a name="an1910"></a><code >filebuf</code> is a specialization of <code >streambuf</code> used by the
file <a name="an1911"></a><code >stream</code> classes. Before using a <code >filebuf</code> the header file
<a name="an1912"></a><code >&lt;fstream&gt;</code> must be included.
<p>
In addition to the (public) members that are available through the <code >class
streambuf</code>, <code >filebuf</code> offers the following (public) members:
    <ul>
    <li><a name="an1913"></a><code >filebuf()</code>:<blockquote ><code >Filebuf</code> offers a public constructor. It initializes
        a plain <code >filebuf</code> object that is not yet connected to a stream.</blockquote>
    <li><a name="an1914"></a><code >bool is_open()</code>:<blockquote ><code >True</code> is returned if the <code >filebuf</code> is actually connected to an
        open file, <code >false</code> otherwise. See the <code >open</code> member, below.</blockquote>
    <li><a name="an1915"></a><code >filebuf *open(char const *name, ios::openmode mode)</code>:<blockquote >Associates the <code >filebuf</code> object with a file
        whose name is provided. The file is opened according to the provided
        <a name="an1916"></a><code >openmode</code>.</blockquote>
    <li><a name="an1917"></a><code >filebuf *close()</code>:<blockquote >Closes the association between the <code >filebuf</code>
        object and its file. The association is automatically closed when the
        <code >filebuf</code> object ceases to exist.</blockquote>
    </ul>
<p>
<a name="STREAMINIT"></a><a name="l303"></a>
<h3 >14.8.3: Safely interfacing streams to another std::streambuf</h3>
    Consider classes derived from <code >std::istream</code> or <code >std::ostream</code>. Such a
class could be designed as follows:
        <pre>
    class XIstream: public std::istream
    {
        public:
            ...
    };
</pre>
    Assuming that the <code >streambuf</code> to which <code >XIstream</code> interfaces is not
yet available construction time, <code >XIstream</code> only offers default
constructors. The class could, however, offer a member <code >void
switchStream(std::streambuf *sb)</code> to provide <code >XIstream</code> objects with a
<code >streambuf</code> to interface to. How to implement <code >switchStream</code>? We could
simply call <code >rdbuf</code>, passing it the pointer to the new streambuf may work,
but the problem is that there may be an existing streambuf, which may have
buffered some information that we don't want to lose.
<p>
Instead of using <code >rdbuf</code> the protected member <code >void</code> <a name="an1918"></a>
<code >init(std::streambuf *sb)</code> should be used for switching to another streambuf
in an existing stream.
<p>
The <code >init</code> member expects a pointer to a streambuf which should be
associated with the <code >istream</code> or <code >ostream</code> object. The <code >init</code> member
properly ends any existing association before switching to the <code >streambuf</code>
whose address is provided to <code >init</code>.
<p>
Assuming that the <code >streambuf</code> to which <code >switchStream</code>'s <code >sb</code> points
persists, then <code >switchStream</code> could simply be implemented like this:
        <pre>
    void switchStream(streambuf *sb)
    {
        init(sb);
    }
</pre>
    No further actions are required. The <code >init</code> member ends the current
association, and only then switches to using  <code >streambuf *sb</code>.

<h2 >14.9: The class `std::error_category'</h2>
The class <code >std::</code><a name="an1919"></a><code >error_category</code> serves as a base class for types that
identify the source and encoding of a particular categories of error codes.
<p>
Before using <code >error_category</code> the <a name="an1920"></a><code >&lt;system_error&gt;</code> header file must be
included.
<p>
Earlier, in section <a href="cplusplus10.html#SYSTEMERROR">10.9</a>, the class <code >error_category</code> was
used. Error category classes are defined as <em >Singletons</em>, <a name="an1921"></a>
(cf. <em >Singleton Design Pattern</em>
    <a name="an1922"></a> (cf. <em >Gamma et al.</em> (1995)
    <a name="an1923"></a> <a name="an1924"></a>Design Patterns, Addison-Wesley)), and several types of
error categories are available in the <code >std</code> namespace: <code >generic_category,
system_category, iostream_category</code> and <code >future_category</code>. 
<p>
To design your own <code >error_category</code> class, it should be derived from
<code >std::error_category</code>, it should be a singleton, and it should merely
support its own set of errors (extending those that are already available in
<strong >C++</strong>), and the behavior of such a derived class should not differ from the
be behavior of the <code >error_category</code> class itself, and it should not alter
<a name="an1925"></a><code >errno</code>'s value, or any other error state provided by other libraries.
<p>
The equality of <code >error_category</code> objects is deduced from their addresses:
because of the singleton characteristics, equal addresses mean equal error
categories.
<p>
The <code >error_category's</code> public interface does not provide a public
constructor. Likewise, copying an existing <code >error_category</code> object is
suppressed as the copy constructor and overloaded assignment operators are
declared as `deleted'. Here is <code >error_category</code>'s non-private class
interface:
        <pre>
    class error_category 
    {
        public:
            error_category(error_category const &amp;) = delete;
            virtual ~error_category() noexcept;

            error_category &amp;operator=(error_category const &amp;) = delete;

            virtual char const *name() const noexcept = 0;
            virtual string message(int ev) const = 0;

            virtual error_condition default_error_condition(
                                        int ev
                                    ) const noexcept;

            virtual bool equivalent(int code, 
                            error_condition const &amp;condition
                         ) const noexcept;

            virtual bool equivalent(
                            error_code const &amp;code, int condition
                         ) const noexcept;

            bool operator==(error_category const &amp;rhs) const noexcept;
            bool operator!=(error_category const &amp;rhs) const noexcept;
            bool operator&lt;(error_category const &amp;rhs) const noexcept;

        protected:
            error_category() noexcept;
    };
    error_category const &amp;generic_category() noexcept;
    error_category const &amp;system_category() noexcept;
    error_category const &amp;iostream_category() noexcept;
    error_category const &amp;future_category() noexcept;
</pre>
<p>
In section <a href="cplusplus23.html#ERRCODEENUM">23.6.3</a> the class <code >error_category</code> is used to define
a new category: <code >CalculatorErrCategory</code>, as well as a matching function
        <pre>
    error_category const &amp;calculator_category() const noexcept;
</pre>
<p>
At the very least a class that's derived from <code >error_category</code> must
override the <code >name</code> and <code >message</code> members. In addition, only the
<code >..._category()</code> functions will be given access to the single existing
object of its category, returning a const reference to it.
<p>
The details of the members of this class are:
    <ul>
    <li><a name="an1926"></a><code >char const *name() const noexcept</code>:<blockquote >returns the mere name of the error category (e.g., <code >"generic"</code> is
        returned by <code >generic_category</code>);</blockquote>
<p>
<li><a name="an1927"></a><code >string message(int ev) const</code>:<blockquote >returns a string describing the error condition matching error value
        <code >ev</code>;</blockquote>
<p>
If the error codes for your error category can be mapped to one of the
        std::errc error codes then default_error_condition should do that
        mapping, and return a std::error_condition with a category of
        std::generic_category() and a value of the corresponding std::errc
        enum value. Otherwise it should return an error_condition referring to
        that category. 
<p>
<li><a name="an1928"></a><code >error_condition default_error_condition(int ev) const noexcept</code>:<blockquote >returns an object of type
        <code >error_condition</code> corresponding to <code >ev</code>. Derived classes
        should make sure that error codes matching POSIX <code >errno</code> values are
        returned as <code >generic_category</code> values;</blockquote>
    <li><a name="an1929"></a><code >bool equivalent(int code, error_condition const &amp;condition) const
        noexcept</code>:<blockquote >returns <code >default_error_condition(code) == condition</code> (<code >true</code> if,
        for the category of error represented by <code >*this</code>, <code >code</code> is
        considered equivalent to <code >condition</code>; otherwise <code >false</code>);</blockquote>
    <li><code >bool equivalent(error_code const &amp;code, int condition) const noexcept</code>:<blockquote >returns <code >*this == code.category() &amp;&amp; code.value() == condition</code>
        (<code >true</code> if, for the category of error represented by <code >*this</code>,
        <code >code</code> is considered equivalent to <code >condition</code>; otherwise
        <code >false</code>);</blockquote>
    <li><code >bool operator&lt;(error_category const &amp;rhs) const noexcept</code>:<blockquote >returns <code >less&lt;const error_category*&gt;()(this, &amp;rhs)</code>.</blockquote>
    </ul>
<p>
Free functions:
    <ul>
    <li><a name="an1930"></a><code >error_category const &amp;generic_category() noexcept</code>:<blockquote >returns a reference to the (note: a singleton, so there's only one
        object) <em >generic</em> <code >error_category</code> object. This function therefore
        returns the same object when repeatedly called.  The returned object's
        <code >name</code> member returns a pointer to the string <code >"generic"</code>;</blockquote>
    <li><a name="an1931"></a><code >error_category const &amp;system_category() noexcept</code>:<blockquote >returns a reference to the <em >operating system</em> <code >error_category</code>
        object: it is used for errors reported by the operating system. The
        object's <code >name</code> member returns a pointer to the string
        <code >"system"</code>. If the argument <code >ev</code> of the function
        <code >error_condition</code>
<p>
corresponds to a POSIX <code >errno</code>
        value `<code >posv</code>', then the object's <code >default_error_condition</code> member
        should return <code >error-condition(posv,
        generic_category())</code>. Otherwise, <code >error_condition(ev,
        system_category())</code> shall be returned.</blockquote>
    </ul>
<p>
<a name="POLYMORPHEXCEPTION"></a><a name="l305"></a>
<h2 >14.10: A polymorphic exception class</h2>
Earlier in the <strong >C++</strong> Annotations (section <a href="cplusplus10.html#EMPTYTHROW">10.3.1</a>) we hinted at the
possibility of designing a class <code >Exception</code> whose <code >process</code> member
would behave differently, depending on the kind of exception that was
thrown. Now that we've introduced <a name="an1932"></a>polymorphism we can further develop this
example.
<p>
It probably does not come as a surprise that our class <code >Exception</code> should be
a polymorphic base class from which special exception handling classes can be
derived. In section <a href="cplusplus10.html#EMPTYTHROW">10.3.1</a> a member <code >severity</code> was used offering
functionality that may be replaced by members of the <code >Exception</code> base class.
<p>
The base class <code >Exception</code> may be  designed as follows:
        <pre>
    #ifndef INCLUDED_EXCEPTION_H_
    #define INCLUDED_EXCEPTION_H_
    #include &lt;iostream&gt;
    #include &lt;string&gt;

    class Exception
    {
        std::string d_reason;

        public:
            Exception(std::string const &amp;reason);
            virtual ~Exception();

            std::ostream &amp;insertInto(std::ostream &amp;out) const;
            void handle() const;

        private:
            virtual void action() const;
    };

    inline void Exception::action() const
    {
        throw;
    }
    inline Exception::Exception(std::string const &amp;reason)
    :
        d_reason(reason)
    {}
    inline void Exception::handle() const
    {
        action();
    }
    inline std::ostream &amp;Exception::insertInto(std::ostream &amp;out) const
    {
        return out &lt;&lt; d_reason;
    }

    inline std::ostream &amp;operator&lt;&lt;(std::ostream &amp;out, Exception const &amp;e)
    {
        return e.insertInto(out);
    }

    #endif
</pre>
    Objects of this class may be inserted into <code >ostream</code>s but the core
element of this class is the virtual member function <code >action</code>, by default
rethrowing an exception.
<p>
A derived class <code >Warning</code> simply prefixes the thrown warning text by the
text <code >Warning:</code>, but a derived class <code >Fatal</code> overrides
<code >Exception::action</code> by calling <a name="an1933"></a><code >std::terminate</code>, forcefully
terminating the program.
<p>
Here are the classes <code >Warning</code> and <code >Fatal</code>
        <pre>
    #ifndef WARNINGEXCEPTION_H_
    #define WARNINGEXCEPTION_H_

    #include "exception.h"

    class Warning: public Exception
    {
        public:
            Warning(std::string const &amp;reason)
            :
                Exception("Warning: " + reason)
            {}
    };
    #endif
</pre>
        <pre>
    #ifndef FATAL_H_
    #define FATAL_H_

    #include "exception.h"

    class Fatal: public Exception
    {
        public:
            Fatal(std::string  const &amp;reason);
        private:
            virtual void action() const;
    };

    inline Fatal::Fatal(std::string  const &amp;reason)
    :
        Exception(reason)
    {}

    inline void Fatal::action() const
    {
        std::cout &lt;&lt; "Fatal::action() terminates" &lt;&lt; '\n';
        std::terminate();
    }

    #endif
</pre>
<p>
When the example program is started without arguments it throws a
<code >Fatal</code> exception, otherwise it throws a <code >Warning</code> exception. Of
course, additional exception types could also easily be defined. To make the
example compilable the <code >Exception</code> destructor is defined above <code >main</code>. The
default destructor cannot be used, as it is a virtual destructor. In practice
the destructor should be defined in its own little source file:
        <pre>
    #include "warning.h"
    #include "fatal.h"

    Exception::~Exception()
    {}

    using namespace std;

    int main(int argc, char **argv)
    try
    {
        try
        {
            if (argc == 1)
                throw Fatal("Missing Argument") ;
            else
                throw Warning("the argument is ignored");
        }
        catch (Exception const &amp;e)
        {
            cout &lt;&lt; e &lt;&lt; '\n';
            e.handle();
        }
    }
    catch(...)
    {
        cout &lt;&lt; "caught rethrown exception\n";
    }
</pre>

<a name="howpolymorphism"></a><a name="l306"></a>
<h2 >14.11: How polymorphism is implemented</h2>
This section briefly describes how <a name="an1934"></a> polymorphism is
implemented in <strong >C++</strong>.  It is not necessary to understand how polymorphism is
implemented if you just want to <em >use</em> polymorphism. However, we think it's
nice to know how polymorphism is possible. Also, knowing how polymorphism is
implemented clarifies why there is a (small) penalty to using polymorphism in
terms of memory usage and efficiency.
<p>
The fundamental idea behind polymorphism is that the compiler does not know
which function to call at compile-time. The appropriate function is
selected at run-time. That means that the address of the function must be
available somewhere, to be looked up prior to the actual call. This
`somewhere' place must be accessible to the object in question. So when a
<code >Vehicle *vp</code> points to a <code >Truck</code> object, then <code >vp-&gt;mass()</code> calls
<code >Truck</code>'s member function. The address of this function is obtained through
the actual object to which <code >vp</code> points.
<p>
Polymorphism is commonly implemented as follows: an object containing virtual
member functions also contains, usually as its first data member a
 <a name="an1935"></a>hidden data member, pointing to an array containing the addresses of the
class's virtual member functions. The hidden data member is usually called the
<a name="an1936"></a><em >vpointer</em>, the array of virtual member function addresses the <a name="an1937"></a><em >vtable</em>.
<p>
The class's vtable is shared by all objects of that class.  The overhead of
polymorphism in terms of <a name="an1938"></a>memory consumption is therefore:
    <ul>
    <li> one vpointer data member per object pointing to:
    <li> one vtable per class.
    </ul>
    Consequently, a statement like <code >vp-&gt;mass</code> first inspects the hidden
data member of the object pointed to by <code >vp</code>. In the case of the vehicle
classification system, this data member points to a table containing two
addresses: one pointer to the function <code >mass</code> and one pointer to the
function <code >setMass</code> (three pointers if the class also defines (as it
should) a virtual destructor). The actually called function is determined from
this table.
<p>
The internal organization of the objects having virtual functions is
illustrated in figures Figure <a href="cplusplus14.html#ImplementationFigure">19</a> and Figure <a href="cplusplus14.html#CaumonFigure">20</a>
(originals provided by <a href="mailto:Guillaume.Caumon@ensg.inpl-nancy.fr">Guillaume Caumon</a>).
<p>
<p><a name="ImplementationFigure"></a><figure >

<p><a name="CaumonFigure"></a><figure >
<img src="polymorphism/caumon.gif" >
<figcaption >Figure 20: Complementary figure, provided by Guillaume Caumon</figcaption>
</figure></p>

<p>
As shown by figures Figure <a href="cplusplus14.html#ImplementationFigure">19</a> and Figure <a href="cplusplus14.html#CaumonFigure">20</a>,
objects potentially using virtual member functions must have one (hidden) data
member to address a table of function pointers. The objects of the classes
<code >Vehicle</code> and <code >Car</code> both address the same table. The class <code >Truck</code>,
however, overrides <code >mass</code>. Consequently, <code >Truck</code> needs its own vtable.
<p>
A small complication arises when a class is derived from multiple base
classes, each defining virtual functions. Consider the following example:
        <pre>
    class Base1
    {
        public:
            virtual ~Base1();
            void fun1();        // calls vOne and vTwo
        private:
            virtual void vOne();
            virtual void vTwo();
    };
    class Base2
    {
        public:
            virtual ~Base2();
            void fun2();        // calls vThree
        private:
            virtual void vThree();
    };
    class Derived: public Base1, public Base2
    {
        public:
            ~Derived() override;
        private:
            void vOne() override;
            void vThree() override;
    };
</pre>
 In the example <code >Derived</code> is multiply derived from <code >Base1</code> and <code >Base2</code>,
each supporting virtual functions. Because of this, <code >Derived</code> also has
virtual functions, and so <code >Derived</code> has a <code >vtable</code> allowing a base class
pointer or reference to access the proper virtual member.
<p>
When <code >Derived::fun1</code> is called (or a <code >Base1</code> pointer pointing to a
<code >Derived</code> object calls <code >fun1</code>) then <code >fun1</code> calls <code >Derived::vOne</code> and
<code >Base1::vTwo</code>. Likewise, when <code >Derived::fun2</code> is called
<code >Derived::vThree</code> is called.
<p>
The complication
 <a name="an1939"></a><a name="an1940"></a> occurs
with <code >Derived</code>'s vtable. When <code >fun1</code> is called its class type determines
the vtable to use and hence which virtual member to call. So when <code >vOne</code> is
called from <code >fun1</code>, it is presumably the second entry in <code >Derived</code>'s
vtable, as it must match the second entry in <code >Base1</code>'s vtable. However, when
<code >fun2</code> calls <code >vThree</code> it apparently is also the second entry in
<code >Derived</code>'s vtable as it must match the second entry in <code >Base2</code>'s vtable.
<p>
Of course this cannot be realized by a single vtable. Therefore, when multiple
inheritance is used (each base class defining virtual members) another
approach is followed to determine which virtual function to call. In this
situation (cf. figure Figure <a href="cplusplus14.html#MultiVtableFig">21</a>) the class <code >Derived</code> receives
<em >two</em> <code >vtable</code>s, one for each of its base classes and each <code >Derived</code>
class object harbors <em >two</em> hidden vpointers, each one pointing to its
corresponding vtable.
<p>
<p><a name="MultiVtableFig"></a><figure >
<img src="polymorphism/multivtable.gif" >
<figcaption >Figure 21: Vtables and vpointers with multiple base classes</figcaption>
</figure></p>

<p>
Since base class pointers, base class references, or base class interface
members unambiguously refer to one of the base classes the compiler can
determine which vpointer to use.
<p>
The following therefore holds true for classes multiply derived from base
classes offering virtual member functions:

    <li> the derived class defines a vtable for each of its base classes
offering virtual members;
    <li> Each derived class object contains as many hidden vpointers as it has
vtables.
    <li> Each of a derived class object's vpointers points to a unique vtable

<h2 >14.12: Undefined reference to vtable ...</h2>
Occasionaly, the linker generates an error like the following:
 <a name="an1941"></a> <a name="an1942"></a>
        <pre>
    In function `Derived::Derived()':
        : undefined reference to `vtable for Derived'
</pre>
    This error is generated when a virtual function's implementation is
missing in a derived class, but the function is mentioned in the derived
class's interface.
<p>
Such a situation is easily encountered:
    <ul>
    <li> Construct a (complete) base class defining a virtual member function;
    <li> Construct a Derived class mentioning the virtual function in its
        interface;
    <li> The Derived class's virtual function is not implemented. Of course,
the compiler doesn't know that the derived class's function is not implemented
and will, when asked, generate code to create a derived class object;
    <li> Eventually, the linker is unable to find the derived class's virtual
member function. Therefore, it is unable to construct the derived class's
vtable;
    <li> The linker complains with the message:
    <pre>
undefined reference to `vtable for Derived'
</pre>
    </ul>
    Here is an example producing the error:
        <pre>
    class Base
    {
        virtual void member();
    };
    inline void Base::member()
    {}
    class Derived: public Base
    {
        virtual void member();      // only declared
    };
    int main()
    {
        Derived d;  // Will compile, since all members were declared.
                    // Linking will fail, since we don't have the
                    // implementation of Derived::member()
    }
</pre>
    It's of course easy to correct the error: implement the derived class's
missing virtual member function.
<p>
Virtual functions should <em >never</em> be implemented inline. Since the vtable
contains the addresses of the class's virtual functions, these functions must
have addresses and so they must have been compiled as real (out-of-line)
functions. By defining virtual functions inline you run the risk that the
compiler simply overlooks those functions as they may very well never be
explicitly called (but only polymorphically, from a base class pointer or
reference). As a result their addresses may never enter their class's vtables
(and even the vtable itself might remain undefined), causing linkage problems
or resulting in programs showing unexpected behavior. All these kinds of
problems are simply avoided: <em >never</em> define virtual members inline (see also
section <a href="cplusplus07.html#NOTINLINE">7.8.2.1</a>).

<h2 >14.13: Virtual constructors</h2>
In section <a href="cplusplus14.html#VIRTDES">14.2</a> we learned that <strong >C++</strong> supports <em >virtual
destructors</em>. Like many other object oriented languages (e.g., <strong >Java</strong>),
however, the notion of a <a name="an1943"></a><em >virtual constructor</em> is not supported. Not having
virtual constructors becomes a liability when only base class references or
pointers are available, and a copy of a derived class object is
required. <em >Gamma et al.</em> (1995) <a name="an1944"></a> discuss the
 <a name="an1945"></a><em >Prototype design pattern</em> <a name="an1946"></a> to deal with this
situation.
<p>
According to the <em >Prototype Design Pattern</em> each derived class is given
the responsibility of implementing a member function returning a pointer to a
copy of the object for which the member is called. The usual name for this
function is <code >clone</code>. Separating the user interface from the reimplementation
interface <code >clone</code> is made part of the interface and <code >newCopy</code> is defined
in the reimplementation interface. A base class supporting `cloning' defines a
virtual destructor, <code >clone</code>, returning <code >newCopy</code>'s return value and the
<em >virtual copy constructor</em>, a pure virtual function, having the prototype
<code >virtual Base *newCopy() const = 0</code>. As <code >newCopy</code> is a pure virtual
function all derived classes must now implement their own `virtual
constructor'.
<p>
This setup suffices in most situations where we have a pointer or
reference to a base class, but it fails when used with abstract
containers. We can't create a <code >vector&lt;Base&gt;</code>, with <code >Base</code> featuring the
pure virtual <code >copy</code> member in its interface, as <code >Base</code> is called to
initialize new elements of such a vector. This is impossible as <code >newCopy</code> is a
pure virtual function, so a <code >Base</code> object can't be constructed.
<p>
The intuitive solution, providing <code >newCopy</code> with a default
implementation, defining it as an ordinary virtual function, fails too as the
container calls <code >Base(Base const &amp;other)</code>, which would have to call
<code >newCopy</code> to copy <code >other</code>.  At this point it is unclear what to do with
that copy, as the new <code >Base</code> object already exists, and contains no <code >Base</code>
pointer or reference data member to assign <code >newCopy</code>'s return value to.
<p>
Alternatively (and preferred) the original <code >Base</code> class (defined as an
<a name="an1947"></a>abstract base class) is kept as-is and a wrapper class <code >Clonable</code> is used
to manage the <code >Base</code> class pointers returned by <code >newCopy</code>. In chapter
<a href="cplusplus17.html#NESTEDCLASSES">17</a> ways to merge <code >Base</code> and <code >Clonable</code> into one class are
discussed, but for now we'll define <code >Base</code> and <code >Clonable</code> as separate
classes.
<p>
The class <code >Clonable</code> is a very standard class. It contains a pointer member
so it needs a copy constructor, destructor, and overloaded assignment
operator. It's given at least one non-standard member: <code >Base &amp;base() const</code>,
returning a reference to the derived object to which <code >Clonable</code>'s <code >Base *</code>
data member refers. It is also provided with an additional constructor to
initialize its <code >Base *</code> data member.
<p>
Any non-abstract class derived from <code >Base</code> must implement <code >Base
*newCopy()</code>, returning a pointer to a newly created (allocated) copy of the
object for which <code >newCopy</code> is called.
<p>
Once we have defined a derived class (e.g., <code >Derived1</code>), we can put our
<code >Clonable</code> and <code >Base</code> facilities to good use.  In the next example we see
<code >main</code> defining a <code >vector&lt;Clonable&gt;</code>. An anonymous <code >Derived1</code>
object is then inserted into the vector using the following steps:
    <ul>
    <li> A new anonymous <code >Derived1</code> object is created;
    <li> It initializes a <code >Clonable</code> using <code >Clonable(Base *bp)</code>;
    <li> The just created <code >Clonable</code> object is inserted into the vector,
using <code >Clonable</code>'s move constructor. There are only temporary <code >Derived</code>
and <code >Clonable</code> objects at this point, so no copy construction is required.
    </ul>
    In this sequence, only the <code >Clonable</code> object containing the <code >Derived1
*</code> is used. No additional copies need to be made (or destroyed).
<p>
Next, the <code >base</code> member is used in combination with <code >typeid</code> to show
the actual type of the <code >Base &amp;</code> object: a <code >Derived1</code> object.
<p>
<code >Main</code> then contains the interesting definition <code >vector&lt;Clonable&gt;
v2(bv)</code>. Here a copy of <code >bv</code> is created. This copy construction observes
the actual types of the <code >Base</code> references, making sure that the appropriate
types appear in the vector's copy.
<p>
At the end of the program, we have created two <code >Derived1</code> objects, which
are correctly deleted by the vector's destructors. Here is the full program,
illustrating the `virtual constructor' concept&nbsp;(
   Jesse van den Kieboom created an alternative implementation of a class
    <code >Clonable</code>, implemented as a <a href="cplusplus22.html#TEMPCLASS">class template</a>. His
    implementation is found in the source archive under
    <code >contrib/classtemplates/</code>.):
