<h1 >Chapter 24: Concrete Examples</h1>
In this chapter concrete examples of <strong >C++</strong> programs, classes and templates
are presented.  Topics covered by the <strong >C++</strong> Annotations such as virtual
functions, <code >static</code> members, etc. are illustrated in this chapter. The
examples roughly follow the organization of earlier chapters.
<p>
As an additional topic, not just providing examples of <strong >C++</strong> the subjects of
<a name="an3228"></a>scanner and <a name="an3229"></a>parser generators are covered. We show how these tools may
be used in <strong >C++</strong> programs. These additional examples assume a certain
familiarity with the concepts underlying these tools, like grammars,
parse-trees and
        <a name="an3230"></a>
        <a name="an3231"></a>
    parse-tree decoration. Once the input for a program exceeds a certain
level of complexity, it's attractive to use scanner- and parser-generators to
create the code doing the actual input processing. One of the
<a href="cplusplus24.html#BisonAndFlex">examples</a> in this chapter describes the usage of these
tools in a <strong >C++</strong> environment.

<h2 >24.1: Using file descriptors with `streambuf' classes</h2>
<p>
<a name="OFDNBUF"></a><a name="l632"></a>
<h3 >24.1.1: Classes for output operations</h3>
        Reading and writing from and to <a name="an3232"></a><em >file descriptors</em> are not part of the
<strong >C++</strong> standard. But on most operating systems file descriptors <em >are</em>
available and can be considered a <a name="an3233"></a>device. It seems natural to use the class
<a name="an3234"></a><code >std::streambuf</code> as the starting point for constructing classes
interfacing such file descriptor devices.
<p>
Below we'll construct classes that can be used to write to a device given
its file descriptor. The devices may be files, but they could also be <a name="an3235"></a>pipes
or <a name="an3236"></a>sockets. Section <a href="cplusplus24.html#STRBUF">24.1.2</a> covers reading from such devices; section
<a href="cplusplus24.html#REDIRECTION">24.2.3</a> reconsiders redirection, discussed earlier in section
<a href="cplusplus06.html#REDIR">6.6.2</a>.
<p>
Using the <code >streambuf</code> class as a base class it is relatively easy to
design classes for output operations. The only member function that <em >must</em>
be overridden is the (virtual) member
 <a name="an3237"></a>
    <code >int streambuf::overflow(int c)</code>. This member's responsibility is to
write characters to the device. If <code >fd</code> is an output file descriptor and if
output should not be buffered then the member <code >overflow()</code> can simply be
implemented as:
        <pre>
    class UnbufferedFD: public std::streambuf
    {
        public:
            virtual int overflow(int c);
            ...
    };

    int UnbufferedFD::overflow(int c)
    {
        if (c != EOF)
        {
            if (write(d_fd, &amp;c, 1) != 1)
                return EOF;
        }
        return c;
    }
</pre>
    The argument received by <code >overflow</code> is either written to the file
descriptor (and returned from <code >overflow</code>), or <code >EOF</code> is returned.
<p>
This simple function does not use output buffering. For various reasons,
using a buffer is usually a good idea (see also the next section).
<p>
When output buffering is used, the <code >overflow</code> member is a bit more
complex as it is only called when the buffer is full. Once the buffer is full,
we <em >first</em> have to flush the buffer. Flushing the buffer is the
responsibility of the (virtual) function <a name="an3238"></a><code >streambuf::sync</code>.  Since
<code >sync</code> is a virtual function, classes derived from <code >streambuf</code> may
redefine <code >sync</code> to flush a buffer <code >streambuf</code> itself doesn't know about.
<p>
Overriding <code >sync</code> and using it in <code >overflow</code> is not all that has to be
done. When the object of the class defining the buffer reaches the end of its
lifetime the buffer may be only partially full. In that situation the buffer
must also be flushed. This is easily done by simply calling <code >sync</code> from the
class's destructor.
<p>
Now that we've considered the consequences of using an output buffer,
we're almost ready to design our derived class. Several more features
are added as well, though:
    <ul>
    <li> First, we should allow the user of the class to specify the size of
the output buffer.
    <li> Second, it should be possible to construct an object of our class
before the file descriptor is actually known. Later, in section <a href="cplusplus24.html#FORK">24.2</a>
we'll encounter a situation where this feature is actually used.
    </ul>
    To save some space in the <strong >C++</strong> Annotations, the successful completion of the
functions designed here is not checked in the example code. In `real life'
implementations these checks should of course not be omitted.  Our class
<code >OFdnStreambuf</code> has the following characteristics:
    <ul>
    <li> Its member functions use low-level functions operating on file
descriptors. So apart from <code >streambuf</code> the <a name="an3239"></a><code >&lt;unistd.h&gt;</code> header file must
have been read by the compiler before its member functions can be compiled.
    <li> The class is derived from <code >std::streambuf</code>.
    <li> It defines three data members. These data members keep track of,
respectively, the size of the buffer, the file descriptor, and the buffer
itself. Here is the full class interface
        <pre>
    class OFdnStreambuf: public std::streambuf
    {
        size_t d_bufsize;
        int     d_fd;
        char    *d_buffer;

        public:
            OFdnStreambuf();
            OFdnStreambuf(int fd, size_t bufsize = 1);
            virtual ~OFdnStreambuf();
            void open(int fd, size_t bufsize = 1);
        private:
            virtual int sync();
            virtual int overflow(int c);
    };
</pre>
<p>
<li> Its default constructor merely initializes the buffer to 0. Slightly
more interesting is its constructor expecting a file descriptor and a buffer
size. This constructor passes its arguments on to the class's <code >open</code>
member (see below). Here are the constructors:
        <pre>
    inline OFdnStreambuf::OFdnStreambuf()
    :
        d_bufsize(0),
        d_buffer(0)
    {}
    inline OFdnStreambuf::OFdnStreambuf(int fd, size_t bufsize)
    {
        open(fd, bufsize);
    }
</pre>
<p>
<li> The destructor calls <code >sync</code>, flushing any characters stored in the
output buffer to the device. In implementations not using a buffer the
destructor can be given a default implementation:
        <pre>
    inline OFdnStreambuf::~OFdnStreambuf()
    {
        if (d_buffer)
        {
            sync();
            delete[] d_buffer;
        }
    }
</pre>
<p>
This implementation does not close the device. It is left as an exercise
to the reader to change this class in such a way that the device is optionally
closed (or optionally remains open). This approach was adopted by, e.g., the
        <a href="http://fbb-git.github.io/bobcat/">Bobcat library</a>.
        <a name="an3240"></a><a name="an3241"></a> See also section
<a href="cplusplus24.html#IFDNBUF">24.1.2.2</a>.
    <li> The <a name="an3242"></a><code >open</code> member initializes the buffer.  Using
<a name="an3243"></a><code >streambuf::setp</code>, the begin and end points of the buffer are
defined. This is used by the <code >streambuf</code> base class to initialize
<a name="an3244"></a><code >streambuf::pbase</code>, <a name="an3245"></a><code >streambuf::pptr</code>, and
<a name="an3246"></a><code >streambuf::epptr</code>:
        <pre>
    inline void OFdnStreambuf::open(int fd, size_t bufsize)
    {
        d_fd = fd;
        d_bufsize = bufsize == 0 ? 1 : bufsize;

        d_buffer = new char[d_bufsize];
        setp(d_buffer, d_buffer + d_bufsize);
    }
</pre>
<p>
<li> The member <a name="an3247"></a><code >sync</code> flushes the as yet unflushed contents of the
buffer to the device. After the flush the buffer is reinitialized using
<code >setp</code>. After successfully flushing the buffer <code >sync</code> returns 0:
        <pre>
    inline int OFdnStreambuf::sync()
    {
        if (pptr() &gt; pbase())
        {
            write(d_fd, d_buffer, pptr() - pbase());
            setp(d_buffer, d_buffer + d_bufsize);
        }
        return 0;
    }
</pre>
<p>
<li> The member <a name="an3248"></a><code >streambuf::overflow</code> is also
overridden. Since this member is called from the <code >streambuf</code> base class when
the buffer is full it should first call <code >sync</code> to flush the buffer to the
device. Next it should write the character <code >c</code> to the (now empty)
buffer. The character <code >c</code> should be written using <code >pptr</code> and
<a name="an3249"></a><code >streambuf::pbump</code>.  Entering a character into the buffer should be
implemented using available <code >streambuf</code> member functions, rather than `by
hand' as doing so might invalidate <code >streambuf</code>'s internal bookkeeping. Here
is <code >overflow</code>'s implementation:
        <pre>
    inline int OFdnStreambuf::overflow(int c)
    {
        sync();
        if (c != EOF)
        {
            *pptr() = c;
            pbump(1);
        }
        return c;
    }
</pre>
<p>
</ul>
    The next program uses the <code >OFfdStreambuf</code> class to copy its standard
input to file descriptor <a name="an3250"></a><code >STDOUT_FILENO</code>, which is the symbolic name of the
file descriptor used for the standard output:
        <pre>
    #include &lt;string&gt;
    #include &lt;iostream&gt;
    #include &lt;istream&gt;
    #include "fdout.h"
    using namespace std;

    int main(int argc, char **argv)
    {
        OFdnStreambuf   fds(STDOUT_FILENO, 500);
        ostream         os(&amp;fds);

        switch (argc)
        {
            case 1:
                for (string  s; getline(cin, s); )
                    os &lt;&lt; s &lt;&lt; '\n';
                os &lt;&lt; "COPIED cin LINE BY LINE\n";
            break;

            case 2:
                cin &gt;&gt; os.rdbuf();      // Alternatively, use:  cin &gt;&gt; &amp;fds;
                os &lt;&lt; "COPIED cin BY EXTRACTING TO os.rdbuf()\n";
            break;

            case 3:
                os &lt;&lt; cin.rdbuf();
                os &lt;&lt; "COPIED cin BY INSERTING cin.rdbuf() into os\n";
            break;
        }
    }
</pre>

<h3 >24.1.2: Classes for input operations</h3>
        When classes for input operation are derived from <a name="an3251"></a><code >std::streambuf</code>, they
should be provided with an input buffer of at least one character. The
one-character input buffer allows for the use of the member functions
<code >istream::putback</code> or <code >istream::ungetc</code>.  Strictly speaking it is not
necessary to implement a buffer in classes derived from <code >streambuf</code>. But
using buffers in these classes is strongly advised. Their implementation is
very simple and straightforward and the applicability of such classes is
greatly improved. Therefore, all our classes derived from the class
<code >streambuf</code> define a buffer of <em >at least</em> one character.
<p>
<a name="IFDBUF"></a><a name="l634"></a>
<h4>24.1.2.1: Using a one-character buffer</h4>
            When deriving a class (e.g., <a name="an3252"></a><code >IFdStreambuf</code>) from <code >streambuf</code> using a
buffer of one character, at least its member
 <a name="an3253"></a>
    <code >streambuf::underflow</code> should be overridden, as this member eventually
receives all requests for input. The member
 <a name="an3254"></a>
    <code >streambuf::setg</code> is used to inform the <code >streambuf</code> base class of the
size and location of the input buffer, so that it is able to set up its input
buffer pointers accordingly. This ensures that <a name="an3255"></a>
<code >streambuf::eback</code>, <a name="an3256"></a> <code >streambuf::gptr</code>, and <a name="an3257"></a>
<code >streambuf::egptr</code> return correct values.
<p>
The class <code >IFdStreambuf</code> is designed like this:
    <ul>
    <li> Its member functions use low-level functions operating on file
descriptors. Therefore, in addition to <code >streambuf</code>, the <a name="an3258"></a><code >&lt;unistd.h&gt;</code>
header file must have been read by the compiler before its member functions
can be compiled.
    <li> Like most classes designed for input operations, this class is derived
from <a name="an3259"></a><code >std::streambuf</code> as well.
    <li> The class defines two data members, one of them a fixed-sized one
character buffer. The data members are defined as <a name="an3260"></a><code >protected</code> data members
so that derived classes (e.g., see section <a href="cplusplus24.html#IFDSEEK">24.1.2.3</a>) can access them. Here
is the full class interface:
        <pre>
    class IFdStreambuf: public std::streambuf
    {
        protected:
            int     d_fd;
            char    d_buffer[1];
        public:
            IFdStreambuf(int fd);
        private:
            int underflow();
    };
</pre>
<p>
<li> The constructor initializes the buffer. However, the initialization
sets <a name="an3261"></a><code >gptr</code>'s return value equal to <a name="an3262"></a><code >egptr</code>'s return value. This
implies that the buffer is empty so <code >underflow</code> is immediately called
to fill the buffer:
        <pre>
    inline IFdStreambuf::IFdStreambuf(int fd)
    :
        d_fd(fd)
    {
        setg(d_buffer, d_buffer + 1, d_buffer + 1);
    }
</pre>
<p>
<li> Finally <code >underflow</code> is overridden. The buffer is refilled by
reading from the file descriptor. If this fails (for whatever reason),
<code >EOF</code> is returned. More sophisticated implementations could act more
intelligently here, of course. If the buffer could be refilled, <a name="an3263"></a><code >setg</code> is
called to set up <code >streambuf</code>'s buffer pointers correctly:
        <pre>
    inline int IFdStreambuf::underflow()
    {
        if (read(d_fd, d_buffer, 1) &lt;= 0)
            return EOF;

        setg(d_buffer, d_buffer, d_buffer + 1);
        return static_cast&lt;unsigned char&gt;(*gptr());
    }
</pre>
<p>
</ul>
    The following <code >main</code> function shows how <code >IFdStreambuf</code> can be used:
        <pre>
    int main()
    {
        IFdStreambuf fds(STDIN_FILENO);
        istream      is(&amp;fds);

        cout &lt;&lt; is.rdbuf();
    }
</pre>
<p>
<a name="IFDNBUF"></a><a name="l635"></a>
<h4>24.1.2.2: Using an n-character buffer</h4>
            How complex would things get if we decided to use a buffer of
substantial size? Not that complex. The following class allows us to specify
the size of a buffer, but apart from that it is basically the same class as
<code >IFdStreambuf</code> developed in the previous section. To make things a bit more
interesting, in the class <a name="an3264"></a><code >IFdNStreambuf</code> developed here, the member
<a name="an3265"></a><code >streambuf::xsgetn</code> is also overridden, to optimize reading a
series of characters. Also a default constructor is provided that can be used
in combination with the <code >open</code> member to construct an <code >istream</code> object
before the file descriptor becomes available. In that case, once the
descriptor becomes available, the <code >open</code> member can be used to initiate
the object's buffer. Later, in section <a href="cplusplus24.html#FORK">24.2</a>, we'll encounter such a
situation.
<p>
To save some space, the success of various calls was not checked. In `real
life' implementations, these checks should of course not be omitted. The
class <code >IFdNStreambuf</code> has the following characteristics:
    <ul>
    <li> Its member functions use low-level functions operating on file
descriptors. So apart from <code >streambuf</code> the <a name="an3266"></a><code >&lt;unistd.h&gt;</code> header file must
have been read by the compiler before its member functions can be compiled.
    <li> As usual, it is derived from <a name="an3267"></a><code >std::streambuf</code>.
    <li> Like the class <code >IFdStreambuf</code> (section <a href="cplusplus24.html#IFDBUF">24.1.2.1</a>), its data
members are protected. Since the buffer's size is configurable, this size is
kept in a dedicated data member, <code >d_bufsize</code>:
            <pre>
    class IFdNStreambuf: public std::streambuf
    {
        protected:
            int         d_fd;
            size_t      d_bufsize;
            char*       d_buffer;
        public:
            IFdNStreambuf();
            IFdNStreambuf(int fd, size_t bufsize = 1);
            virtual ~IFdNStreambuf();
            void open(int fd, size_t bufsize = 1);
        private:
            virtual int underflow();
            virtual std::streamsize xsgetn(char *dest, std::streamsize n);
    };
</pre>
<p>
<li> The default constructor does not allocate a buffer. It can be used
to construct an object before the file descriptor becomes known. A second
constructor simply passes its arguments to <code >open</code>. <code >Open</code> will then
initialize the object so that it can actually be used:
            <pre>
    inline IFdNStreambuf::IFdNStreambuf()
    :
        d_bufsize(0),
        d_buffer(0)
    {}
    inline IFdNStreambuf::IFdNStreambuf(int fd, size_t bufsize)
    {
        open(fd, bufsize);
    }
</pre>
<p>
<li> Once the object has been initialized by <code >open</code>, its destructor will
both delete the object's buffer and use the file descriptor to close the
device:
            <pre>
    IFdNStreambuf::~IFdNStreambuf()
    {
        if (d_bufsize)
        {
            close(d_fd);
            delete[] d_buffer;
        }
    }
</pre>
<p>
Even though the device is closed in the above implementation this may not
always be desirable. In cases where the open file descriptor is already
available the intention may be to use that descriptor repeatedly, each time
using a newly constructed <code >IFdNStreambuf</code> object. It is left as an exercise
to the reader to change this class in such a way that the device may
optionally be closed. This approach was followed in, e.g., the
        <a href="http://fbb-git.github.io/bobcat/">Bobcat library</a>.
        <a name="an3268"></a><a name="an3269"></a>
    <li> The <code >open</code> member simply allocates the object's buffer. It is
assumed that the calling program has already opened the device. Once the
buffer has been allocated, the base class member <a name="an3270"></a><code >setg</code> is used to ensure
that <a name="an3271"></a> <code >streambuf::eback</code> <a name="an3272"></a> <code >streambuf::gptr</code> and <a name="an3273"></a>
<code >streambuf::egptr</code> return correct values:
            <pre>
    void IFdNStreambuf::open(int fd, size_t bufsize)
    {
        d_fd = fd;
        d_bufsize = bufsize;
        d_buffer = new char[d_bufsize];
        setg(d_buffer, d_buffer + d_bufsize, d_buffer + d_bufsize);
    }
</pre>
<p>
<li> The overridden member <code >underflow</code> is implemented almost
identically to <code >IFdStreambuf</code>'s (section <a href="cplusplus24.html#IFDBUF">24.1.2.1</a>) member. The only
difference is that the current class supports buffers of larger
sizes. Therefore, more characters (up to <code >d_bufsize</code>) may be read from the
device at once:
            <pre>
    int IFdNStreambuf::underflow()
    {
        if (gptr() &lt; egptr())
            return *gptr();

        int nread = read(d_fd, d_buffer, d_bufsize);

        if (nread &lt;= 0)
            return EOF;

        setg(d_buffer, d_buffer, d_buffer + nread);
        return static_cast&lt;unsigned char&gt;(*gptr());
    }
</pre>
<p>
<li> Finally <a name="an3274"></a><code >xsgetn</code> is overridden. In a loop, <code >n</code> is reduced until
0, at which point the function terminates. Alternatively, the member returns
if <code >underflow</code> fails to obtain more characters. This member optimizes the
reading of series of characters. Instead of calling <a name="an3275"></a>
<code >streambuf::sbumpc</code> <code >n</code> times, a block of <code >avail</code> characters is copied
to the destination, using <a name="an3276"></a><code >streambuf::gbump</code> to consume <code >avail</code>
characters from the buffer using one function call:
            <pre>
    std::streamsize IFdNStreambuf::xsgetn(char *dest, std::streamsize n)
    {
        int nread = 0;

        while (n)
        {
            if (!in_avail())
            {
                if (underflow() == EOF)
                    break;
            }

    The member function <a name="an3277"></a><code >xsgetn</code> is called by <a name="an3278"></a><code >streambuf::sgetn</code>,

this member function with an <code >IFdNStreambuf</code> object:

<h4>24.1.2.3: Seeking positions in `streambuf' objects</h4>
            When devices support <em >seek operations</em>, classes derived from
<a name="an3279"></a> <code >std::streambuf</code> should override the members <a name="an3280"></a>
<code >streambuf::seekoff</code> and <a name="an3281"></a><code >streambuf::seekpos</code>. The class
<a name="an3282"></a><code >IFdSeek</code>, developed in this section, can be used to read information from
devices supporting seek operations. The class <code >IFdSeek</code> was derived from
<code >IFdStreambuf</code>, so it uses a character buffer of just one character. The
facilities to perform seek operations, which are added to our new class
<code >IFdSeek</code>, ensure that the input buffer is reset when a seek operation is
requested. The class could also be derived from the class
<code >IFdNStreambuf</code>. In that case the arguments to reset the input buffer
must be adapted so that its second and third parameters point beyond the
available input buffer. Let's have a look at the characteristics of
<code >IFdSeek</code>:
    <ul>
    <li> As mentioned, <code >IFdSeek</code> is derived from <code >IFdStreambuf</code>. Like the
latter class, <code >IFdSeek</code>'s member functions use facilities declared in
<code >unistd.h</code>. So, the header file <a name="an3283"></a><code >&lt;unistd.h&gt;</code> must have been read by the
compiler before it can compile the class's members functions.  To reduce the
amount of typing when specifying types and constants from <code >streambuf</code> and
<a name="an3284"></a><code >std::ios</code>, several <code >typedef</code>s are defined by the class.  These
typedefs refer to types that are defined in the header file <a name="an3285"></a><code >&lt;ios&gt;</code>, which
must therefore also be included before the compiler can compile <code >IFdSeek</code>'s
class interface:
        <pre>
    class IFdSeek: public IFdStreambuf
    {
        typedef std::streambuf::pos_type        pos_type;
        typedef std::streambuf::off_type        off_type;
        typedef std::ios::seekdir               seekdir;
        typedef std::ios::openmode              openmode;

        public:
            IFdSeek(int fd);
        private:
            pos_type seekoff(off_type offset, seekdir dir, openmode);
            pos_type seekpos(pos_type offset, openmode mode);
    };
</pre>
<p>
<li> The class has a very basic interface. Its (only)
constructor expects the device's <a name="an3286"></a>file descriptor. It has no special tasks
to perform and just calls its <a name="an3287"></a>base class constructor:
        <pre>
    inline IFdSeek::IFdSeek(int fd)
    :
        IFdStreambuf(fd)
    {}
</pre>
<p>
<li> The member <a name="an3288"></a><code >seek_off</code> is responsible for performing the actual
seek operations. It calls <a name="an3289"></a><code >lseek</code> to seek a new position in a device whose
file descriptor is known. If seeking succeeds, <a name="an3290"></a><code >setg</code> is called to define
an already empty buffer, so that the base class's <code >underflow</code> member
refills the buffer at the next input request.
        <pre>
    IFdSeek::pos_type IFdSeek::seekoff(off_type off, seekdir dir, openmode)
    {
        pos_type pos =
            lseek
            (
                d_fd, off,
                (dir ==  std::ios::beg) ? SEEK_SET :
                (dir ==  std::ios::cur) ? SEEK_CUR :
                                          SEEK_END
            );

        if (pos &lt; 0)
            return -1;

        setg(d_buffer, d_buffer + 1, d_buffer + 1);
        return pos;
    }
</pre>
<p>
<li> Finally,  the companion function <a name="an3291"></a><code >seekpos</code> is overridden as well:
it is actually defined as a call to <code >seekoff</code>:
        <pre>
    inline IFdSeek::pos_type IFdSeek::seekpos(pos_type off, openmode mode)
    {
        return seekoff(off, std::ios::beg, mode);
    }
</pre>
<p>
</ul>
    Here is an example of a program using the class <code >IFdSeek</code>. If
this program is given its own source file using input redirection then
seeking is supported (and with the exception of the first line, every other
line is shown twice):
        <pre>
    #include "fdinseek.h"
    #include &lt;string&gt;
    #include &lt;iostream&gt;
    #include &lt;istream&gt;
    #include &lt;iomanip&gt;
    using namespace std;

    int main()
    {
        IFdSeek fds(0);
        istream is(&amp;fds);
        string  s;

        while (true)
        {
            if (!getline(is, s))
                break;

            streampos pos = is.tellg();

            cout &lt;&lt; setw(5) &lt;&lt; pos &lt;&lt; ": `" &lt;&lt; s &lt;&lt; "'\n";

            if (!getline(is, s))
                break;

            streampos pos2 = is.tellg();

            cout &lt;&lt; setw(5) &lt;&lt; pos2 &lt;&lt; ": `" &lt;&lt; s &lt;&lt; "'\n";

            if (!is.seekg(pos))
            {
                cout &lt;&lt; "Seek failed\n";
                break;
            }
        }
    }

<h4>24.1.2.4: Multiple `unget' calls in `streambuf' objects</h4>
        <code >Streambuf</code> classes and classes derived from <a name="an3292"></a><code >streambuf</code> should support
<em >at least</em> ungetting the last read character. Special care must be taken
when <em >series</em> of <a name="an3293"></a><code >unget</code> calls must be supported. In this section the
construction of a class supporting a configurable number of <code >istream::unget</code>
or <a name="an3294"></a><code >istream::putback</code> calls is discussed.
<p>
Support for multiple (say `<code >n</code>') <code >unget</code> calls is implemented by
reserving an initial section of the input buffer, which is gradually filled up
to contain the last <code >n</code> characters read. The class is implemented as
follows:
    <ul>
    <li> Once again, the class is derived from <code >std::streambuf</code>. It
defines several data members, allowing the class to perform the bookkeeping
required to maintain an unget-buffer of a configurable size:
        <pre>
    class FdUnget: public std::streambuf
    {
        int     d_fd;
        size_t  d_bufsize;
        size_t  d_reserved;
        char   *d_buffer;
        char   *d_base;
        public:
            FdUnget(int fd, size_t bufsz, size_t unget);
            virtual ~FdUnget();
        private:
            int underflow();
    };
</pre>
<p>
<li> The class's constructor expects a <a name="an3295"></a>file descriptor, a buffer size
and the number of characters that can be ungot or pushed back as its
arguments. This number  determines the size of a <em >reserved</em> area,
defined as the first <code >d_reserved</code> bytes of the class's input buffer.
        <ul>
        <li> The input buffer will always be at least one byte larger than
<code >d_reserved</code>. So, a certain number of bytes may be read. Once <code >d_reserved</code>
bytes have been read at most <code >d_reserved</code> bytes can be ungot.
        <li> Next, the starting point for reading operations is configured. It
is called <code >d_base</code>, pointing to a location <code >d_reserved</code> bytes beyond the
location represented by <code >d_buffer</code>. This is always the location where buffer
refills start.
        <li> Now that the buffer has been constructed, we're ready to define
<code >streambuf</code>'s buffer pointers using <code >setg</code>. As no characters have been
read yet, all pointers are set to point to <code >d_base</code>. If <code >unget</code> is
called at this point, no characters are available, and <code >unget</code>
(correctly) fails.
        <li> Eventually, the refill buffer's size is determined as the
number of allocated bytes minus the size of the reserved area.
        </ul>
        Here is the class's constructor:
            <pre>
    FdUnget::FdUnget(int fd, size_t bufsz, size_t unget)
    :
        d_fd(fd),
        d_reserved(unget)
    {
        size_t allocate =
                bufsz &gt; d_reserved ?
                    bufsz
                :
                    d_reserved + 1;

        d_buffer = new char[allocate];

        d_base = d_buffer + d_reserved;
        setg(d_base, d_base, d_base);

        d_bufsize = allocate - d_reserved;
    }
</pre>
<p>
<li> The class's destructor simply returns the memory allocated for the
buffer to the common pool:
            <pre>
    inline FdUnget::~FdUnget()
    {
        delete[] d_buffer;
    }
</pre>
<p>
<li> Finally,  <code >underflow</code> is overridden as follows:
        <ul>
        <li> First <code >underflow</code> determines the number of characters that
could potentially be ungot. If that number of characters are ungot, the input
buffer is exhausted. So this value may be any value between 0 (the initial
state) or the input buffer's size (when the reserved area has been filled up
completely, and all current characters in the remaining section of the buffer
have also been read);
        <li> Next the number of bytes to move into the reserved area is
computed. This number is at most <code >d_reserved</code>, but it is set equal to the
actual number of characters that can be ungot if this value is smaller;
        <li> Now that the number of characters to move into the reserved area
is known, this number of characters is moved from the input buffer's end to
the area immediately before <code >d_base</code>;
        <li> Then the buffer is refilled. This all is standard, but notice
that reading starts from <code >d_base</code> and not from <code >d_buffer</code>;
        <li> Finally, <code >streambuf</code>'s read buffer pointers are set up.
                <a name="an3296"></a>
            <code >Eback</code> is set to <code >move</code> locations before <code >d_base</code>, thus
defining the guaranteed unget-area,
            <a name="an3297"></a><code >gptr</code> is set to <code >d_base</code>, since that's the location of the
first read character after a refill, and
            <a name="an3298"></a><code >egptr</code> is set just beyond the location of the last character
read into the buffer.
        </ul>
        Here is <code >underflow</code>'s implementation:
            <pre>
    int FdUnget::underflow()
    {
        size_t ungetsize = gptr() - eback();
        size_t move = std::min(ungetsize, d_reserved);

        memcpy(d_base - move, egptr() - move, move);

        int nread = read(d_fd, d_base, d_bufsize);
        if (nread &lt;= 0)       // none read -&gt; return EOF
            return EOF;

        setg(d_base - move, d_base, d_base + nread);

        return static_cast&lt;unsigned char&gt;(*gptr());
    }
</pre>
<p>
</ul>
<p>
<strong >An example using FdUnget</strong>
<p>
The next example program illustrates the use of the class <code >FdUnget</code>. It
reads at most 10 characters from the standard input, stopping at
<code >EOF</code>. A guaranteed unget-buffer of 2 characters is defined in a buffer
holding 3 characters. Just before reading a character, the program tries to
unget at most 6 characters. This is, of course, not possible; but the program
nicely ungets as many characters as possible, considering the actual
number of characters read:
        <pre>
    #include "fdunget.h"
    #include &lt;string&gt;
    #include &lt;iostream&gt;
    #include &lt;istream&gt;
    using namespace std;

    int main()
    {
        FdUnget fds(0, 3, 2);
        istream is(&amp;fds);
        char    c;

        for (int idx = 0; idx &lt; 10; ++idx)
        {
            cout &lt;&lt; "after reading " &lt;&lt; idx &lt;&lt; " characters:\n";
            for (int ug = 0; ug &lt;= 6; ++ug)
            {
                if (!is.unget())
                {
                    cout
                    &lt;&lt; "\tunget failed at attempt " &lt;&lt; (ug + 1) &lt;&lt; "\n"
                    &lt;&lt; "\trereading: '";

                    is.clear();
                    while (ug--)
                    {
                        is.get(c);
                        cout &lt;&lt; c;
                    }
                    cout &lt;&lt; "'\n";
                    break;
                }
            }

            if (!is.get(c))
            {
                cout &lt;&lt; " reached\n";
                break;
            }
            cout &lt;&lt; "Next character: " &lt;&lt; c &lt;&lt; '\n';
        }
    }

<h3 >24.1.3: Fixed-sized field extraction from istream objects</h3>
    Usually when extracting information from <code >istream</code> objects <code >operator</code>&gt;&gt;, the
standard extraction operator is perfectly suited for the task as in most
cases the extracted fields are white-space (or otherwise clearly) separated
from each other. But this does not hold true in all situations. For example,
when a web-form is posted to some processing script or program, the receiving
program may receive the form field's values as <em >url-encoded</em>
characters: letters and digits are sent unaltered, blanks are sent as <code >+</code>
characters, and all other characters start with <code >%</code> followed by the
character's
    <a name="an3299"></a>ascii-value represented by its two digit hexadecimal value.
<p>
When decoding url-encoded information, simple hexadecimal extraction won't
work, as  that extracts as many hexadecimal characters as available,
instead of just two. Since the letters <code >a-f`</code> and <code >0-9</code> are legal
hexadecimal characters, a text like <code >My name is `Ed'</code>, url-encoded as
        <pre>
    My+name+is+%60Ed%27
</pre>
    results in the extraction of the hexadecimal values <code >60ed</code> and <code >27</code>,
instead of <code >60</code> and <code >27</code>. The name <code >Ed</code> disappears from view, which is
clearly not what we want.
<p>
In this case, having seen the <code >%</code>, we could extract 2 characters, put
them in an <a name="an3300"></a><code >istringstream</code> object, and extract the hexadecimal value from
the <code >istringstream</code> object. A bit cumbersome, but doable. Other approaches
are possible as well.
<p>
The class <a name="an3301"></a><code >Fistream</code> for <em >fixed-sized field istream</em> defines
an <code >istream</code> class supporting both fixed-sized field extractions and
blank-delimited extractions (as well as unformatted <code >read</code> calls). The
class may be initialized as a <a name="an3302"></a><em >wrapper</em> around an existing <code >istream</code>, or
it can be initialized using the name of an existing file. The class is derived
from <code >istream</code>, allowing all extractions and operations supported by
<code >istream</code>s in general. <code >Fistream</code> defines the following data members:
    <ul>
    <li><code >d_filebuf</code>: a filebuffer used when <code >Fistream</code> reads its information
        from a named (existing) file. Since the filebuffer is only needed in
        that case, and since it must be allocated dynamically, it is defined
        as a <code >unique_ptr&lt;filebuf&gt;</code> object.
    <li><code >d_streambuf</code>: a pointer to <code >Fistream</code>'s <code >streambuf</code>. It points
        to <code >d_filebuf</code> when <code >Fistream</code> opens a file by name. When an
        existing <code >istream</code> is used to construct an <code >Fistream</code>, it
        points to the existing <code >istream</code>'s <code >streambuf</code>.
    <li><code >d_iss</code>: an <code >istringstream</code> object used for the fixed field
        extractions.
    <li><code >d_width</code>: a <code >size_t</code> indicating the width of the field to
        extract. If 0 no fixed field extractions is used, but
        information is extracted from the <code >istream</code> base class object
        using standard extractions.
    </ul>
    Here is the initial section of <code >Fistream</code>'s class interface:
        <pre>
    class Fistream: public std::istream
    {
        std::unique_ptr&lt;std::filebuf&gt; d_filebuf;
        std::streambuf *d_streambuf;
        std::istringstream d_iss;
        size_t d_width;
</pre>
<p>
As stated, <code >Fistream</code> objects can be constructed from either a
filename or an existing <code >istream</code> object. The class interface therefore
declares two constructors:
        <pre>
            Fistream(std::istream &amp;stream);
            Fistream(char const *name,
                std::ios::openmode mode = std::ios::in);
</pre>
<p>
When an <code >Fistream</code> object is constructed using an existing <code >istream</code>
object, the <code >Fistream</code>'s <code >istream</code> part simply uses the <code >stream</code>'s
<code >streambuf</code> object:
        <pre>
Fistream::Fistream(istream &amp;stream)
:
    istream(stream.rdbuf()),
    d_streambuf(rdbuf()),
    d_width(0)
{}
</pre>
<p>
When an <code >fstream</code> object is constructed using a filename, the
<code >istream</code> base initializer is given a new <code >filebuf</code> object to be used as
its <code >streambuf</code>. Since the class's data members are not initialized before
the class's base class has been constructed, <code >d_filebuf</code> can only be
initialized thereafter. By then, the <code >filebuf</code> is only available as
<code >rdbuf</code>, returning a <code >streambuf</code>. However, as it is actually a
<code >filebuf</code>, a <code >static_cast</code> is used to cast the <code >streambuf</code> pointer
returned by <code >rdbuf</code> to <code >a filebuf *</code>, so <code >d_filebuf</code> can be initialized:
        <pre>
Fistream::Fistream(char const *name, ios::openmode mode)
:
    istream(new filebuf()),
    d_filebuf(static_cast&lt;filebuf *&gt;(rdbuf())),
    d_streambuf(d_filebuf.get()),
    d_width(0)
{
    d_filebuf-&gt;open(name, mode);
}
</pre>

<h4>24.1.3.1: Member functions and example</h4>
            There is only one additional public member: <code >setField(field const
&amp;)</code>. This member defines the size of the next field to extract. Its
parameter is a reference to a <code >field</code> class, a <em >manipulator class</em>
defining the width of the next field.
<p>
Since a <code >field &amp;</code> is mentioned in <code >Fistream</code>'s interface, <code >field</code>
must be declared before <code >Fistream</code>'s interface starts. The class <code >field</code>
itself is simple and declares <code >Fistream</code> as its friend. It has two data
members: <code >d_width</code> specifies the width of the next field, and <code >d_newWidth</code>
which is set to <code >true</code> if <code >d_width</code>'s value should actually be used. If
<code >d_newWidth</code> is false, <code >Fistream</code> returns to its standard extraction
mode. The class <code >field</code> has two constructors: a default
constructor, setting <code >d_newWidth</code> to <code >false</code>, and a second constructor
expecting the width of the next field to extract as its value. Here is the
class <code >field</code>:
        <pre>
    class field
    {
        friend class Fistream;
        size_t d_width;
        bool     d_newWidth;

        public:
            field(size_t width);
            field();
    };

    inline field::field(size_t width)
    :
        d_width(width),
        d_newWidth(true)
    {}

    inline field::field()
    :
        d_newWidth(false)
    {}
</pre>
<p>
Since <code >field</code> declares <code >Fistream</code> as its friend, <code >setField</code> may
inspect <code >field</code>'s members directly.
<p>
Time to return to <code >setField</code>. This function expects a reference to a
<code >field</code> object, initialized in one of three different ways:
    <ul>
    <li><code >field()</code>: When <code >setField</code>'s argument is a <code >field</code> object
        constructed by its default constructor the next extraction will use
        the same fieldwidth as the previous extraction.
    <li><code >field(0)</code>: When this <code >field</code> object is used as <code >setField</code>'s
        argument, fixed-sized field extraction stops, and the <code >Fistream</code>
        acts like any standard <code >istream</code> object again.
    <li><code >field(x)</code>: When the <code >field</code> object itself is initialized by a
        non-zero size_t value <code >x</code>, then the next field width is <code >x</code>
        characters wide. The preparation of such a field is left to
        <code >setBuffer</code>, <code >Fistream</code>'s only private member.
    </ul>
    Here is <code >setField</code>'s implementation:
        <pre>
std::istream &amp;Fistream::setField(field const &amp;params)
{
    if (params.d_newWidth)                  // new field size requested
        d_width = params.d_width;           // set new width

    if (!d_width)                           // no width?
        rdbuf(d_streambuf);                 // return to the old buffer
    else
        setBuffer();                        // define the extraction buffer

    return *this;
}
</pre>
<p>
The private member <code >setBuffer</code> defines a buffer of <code >d_width + 1</code>
characters and uses <code >read</code> to fill the buffer with <code >d_width</code>
characters. The buffer is an NTBS. This buffer is used to initialize the
<code >d_iss</code> member. <code >Fistream</code>'s <code >rdbuf</code> member is used to extract the
<code >d_str</code>'s data via the <code >Fistream</code> object itself:
        <pre>
void Fistream::setBuffer()
{
    char *buffer = new char[d_width + 1];

    rdbuf(d_streambuf);                         // use istream's buffer to
    buffer[read(buffer, d_width).gcount()] = 0; // read d_width chars,
                                                // terminated by a 0-byte
    d_iss.str(buffer);
    delete[] buffer;

    rdbuf(d_iss.rdbuf());                       // switch buffers
}
</pre>
<p>
Although <code >setField</code> could be used to configure <code >Fistream</code> to use or
not to use fixed-sized field extraction, using manipulators is probably
preferable. To allow <code >field</code> objects to be used as manipulators an
overloaded extraction operator was defined. This extraction operator accepts
<code >istream &amp;</code> and a <code >field const &amp;</code> objects. Using this extraction
operator, statements like
        <pre>
fis &gt;&gt; field(2) &gt;&gt; x &gt;&gt; field(0);
</pre>
    are possible (assuming <code >fis</code> is a <code >Fistream</code> object). Here is the
overloaded <code >operator</code>&gt;&gt;, as well as its declaration:
        <pre>
istream &amp;std::operator&gt;&gt;(istream &amp;str, field const &amp;params)
{
    return static_cast&lt;Fistream *&gt;(&amp;str)-&gt;setField(params);
}
</pre>
<p>
Declaration:
        <pre>
namespace std
{
    istream &amp;operator&gt;&gt;(istream &amp;str, FBB::field const &amp;params);
}
</pre>
<p>
Finally, an example. The following program uses a <code >Fistream</code> object to
url-decode url-encoded information appearing at its standard input:
        <pre>
    int main()
    {
        Fistream fis(cin);

        fis &gt;&gt; hex;
        while (true)
        {
            size_t x;
            switch (x = fis.get())
            {
                case '\n':
                    cout &lt;&lt; '\n';
                break;
                case '+':
                    cout &lt;&lt; ' ';
                break;
                case '%':
                    fis &gt;&gt; field(2) &gt;&gt; x &gt;&gt; field(0);
                // FALLING THROUGH
                default:
                    cout &lt;&lt; static_cast&lt;char&gt;(x);
                break;
                case EOF:
                return 0;
            }
        }
    }
    /*
        Generated output after:
            echo My+name+is+%60Ed%27 | a.out

        My name is `Ed'

<h2 >24.2: The `fork' system call</h2>
From the <strong >C</strong> programming language the <a name="an3303"></a><code >fork</code> system call is well
known. When a program needs to start a new process, <a name="an3304"></a><code >system</code> can be used.
The function <code >system</code> requires the program to wait for the
        <a name="an3305"></a><em >child process</em>
    to terminate. The more general way to spawn subprocesses is to use
<code >fork</code>.
<p>
In this section we investigate how <strong >C++</strong> can be used to wrap classes around
a complex system call like <code >fork</code>. Much of what follows in this section
directly applies to the Unix operating system, and the discussion therefore
focuses on that operating system. Other systems usually provide
comparable facilities. What follows is closely related to the
 <em >Template Design Pattern</em><a name="an3306"></a> (cf. <em >Gamma et al.</em> (1995)
    <a name="an3307"></a> <a name="an3308"></a>Design Patterns, Addison-Wesley)
<p>
When <code >fork</code> is called, the current program is duplicated in memory, thus
creating a new process. Following this duplication both processes continue
their execution just below the <code >fork</code> system call. The two processes may
inspect <code >fork</code>'s return value: the return value in the
original process (called the <a name="an3309"></a><em >parent process</em>) differs from the return
value in the newly created process (called the <a name="an3310"></a><em >child process</em>):
    <ul>
    <li> In the <em >parent process</em> <code >fork</code> returns the <a name="an3311"></a><em >process ID</em> of the
(child) process that was created by the <code >fork</code> system call. This is a
positive integer value.
    <li> In the <em >child process</em> <code >fork</code> returns 0.
    <li> If <code >fork</code> fails, -1 is returned.
    </ul>
<p>
<a name="l641"></a>
<h3 >24.2.1: A basic Fork class</h3>
    
    A basic <code >Fork</code> class should hide all bookkeeping details of a system
call like <code >fork</code> from its users. The class <code >Fork</code> developed here does
just that. The class itself only ensures the proper execution of the <code >fork</code>
system call. Normally, <code >fork</code> is called to start a child process, usually
boiling down to the execution of a separate process. This child process may
expect input at its standard input stream and/or may generate output to its
standard output and/or standard error streams. <code >Fork</code> does not know all
this, and does not have to know what the child process will do. <code >Fork</code>
objects should be able to start their child processes.
<p>
<code >Fork</code>'s constructor cannot know what actions its child
process should perform. Similarly, it cannot know what actions the parent
process should perform. For these kind of  situations, the
        <a name="an3312"></a><em >template method design pattern</em>
        <a name="an3313"></a>
    was developed. According to Gamma c.s., the <em >template method design
pattern</em>
    <blockquote >
    ``Define(s) the skeleton of an algorithm in an operation, deferring some
    steps to subclasses. [The] Template Method (design pattern) lets
    subclasses redefine certain steps of an algorithm, without changing
    the algorithm's structure.''
    </blockquote>
<p>
This design pattern allows us to define an <a name="an3314"></a><em >abstract base class</em>
        <a name="an3315"></a>
    already providing the essential steps related to the <code >fork</code> system call,
deferring the implementation of other parts of the <code >fork</code> system call to
subclasses.
<p>
The <code >Fork</code> abstract base class has the following characteristics:
    <ul>
    <li> It defines a data member <code >d_pid</code>. In the parent process this data
member contains the child's <a name="an3316"></a><em >process id</em> and in the child process it has
the value 0. Its public interface declares only two members:
    <ul>
    <li> a <a name="an3317"></a><code >fork</code> member function, responsible for the actual forking (i.e.,
        it creates the (new) child process);
    <li> a <code >virtual</code> destructor <code >~Fork</code> (having an empty body).
    </ul>
    Here is <code >Fork</code>'s interface:
            <pre>
    class Fork
    {
        int d_pid;

        public:
            virtual ~Fork();
            void fork();

        protected:
            int pid() const;
            int waitForChild();                 // returns the status

        private:
            virtual void childRedirections();
            virtual void parentRedirections();

            virtual void childProcess() = 0;    // pure virtual members
            virtual void parentProcess() = 0;
    };
</pre>
<p>
<li> All other non-virtual member functions are declared in the class's
<code >protected</code> section and can thus <em >only</em> be used by derived classes. They
are:
        <ul>
        <li><code >pid()</code>: The member function <code >pid</code> allows derived classes to
            access the system <code >fork</code>'s return value:
                <pre>
    inline int Fork::pid() const
    {
        return d_pid;
    }
</pre>
<p>
<li><code >waitForChild()</code>: The member <code >int waitForChild</code> can be called by
            parent processes to wait for the completion of their child
            processes (as discussed below). This member is declared in the
            class interface. Its implementation is:
                <pre>
    #include "fork.ih"

    int Fork::waitForChild()
    {
        int status;

        waitpid(d_pid, &amp;status, 0);

        return WEXITSTATUS(status);
    }
</pre>
<p>
This simple implementation returns the child's <a name="an3318"></a><em >exit status</em> to
            the parent. The called system function <a name="an3319"></a><code >waitpid</code> <em >blocks</em>
            until the child terminates.
        </ul>
    <li> When <code >fork</code> system calls are used,
            <em >parent processes</em> <a name="an3320"></a>
        and
            <em >child processes</em> <a name="an3321"></a>
        must always be distinguished. The main distinction between these
        processes is that <code >d_pid</code> becomes the child's process-id in the
        parent process, while <code >d_pid</code> becomes 0 in the child process
        itself. Since these two processes must always be distinguished (and
        present), their implementation by classes derived from <code >Fork</code> is
        enforced by <code >Fork</code>'s interface: the members <code >childProcess</code>,
        defining the child process' actions and <code >parentProcess</code>, defining
        the parent process' actions were defined as pure virtual functions.
<p>
<li> communication between parent- and child processes
        may use standard streams or other facilities, like <em >pipes</em>
        (cf. section <a href="cplusplus24.html#PIPE">24.2.5</a>). To facilitate this inter-process
        communication, derived classes <em >may</em> implement:
        <ul>
        <li><code >childRedirections()</code>: this member should be overridden by derived
            classes if any standard stream (<code >cin, cout,</code>) or <code >cerr</code> must
            be redirected in the <em >child</em> process (cf. section
            <a href="cplusplus24.html#REDIRECTION">24.2.3</a>). By default it has an empty implementation;
        <li><code >parentRedirections()</code>: this member should be overridden by derived
            classes if any standard stream (<code >cin, cout,</code>) or <code >cerr</code> must
            be redirected in the <em >parent</em> process. By default it has an
            empty implementation.
        </ul>
    Redirection of the standard streams is necessary if parent and
child processes must communicate with each other via the standard streams.
Here are their default definitions. Since these functions are virtual
functions they should not be implemented inline, but in their own source file:
            <pre>
    void Fork::childRedirections()
    {}
    void Fork::parentRedirections()
    {}
</pre>
<p>
</ul>
<p>
<a name="l642"></a>
<h3 >24.2.2: Parents and Children</h3>
        The member function <code >fork</code> calls the system function <code >fork</code>
(Caution: since the system function <code >fork</code> is called by a member
function having the same name, the <code >::</code> scope resolution operator must be
used to prevent a recursive call of the member function itself).
The function <code >::fork</code>'s  return value determines whether <code >parentProcess</code>
or  <code >childProcess</code> is called. Maybe redirection is
necessary. <code >Fork::fork</code>'s implementation calls <code >childRedirections</code>
just before calling <code >childProcess</code>, and <code >parentRedirections</code> just
before calling <code >parentProcess</code>:
        <pre>
    #include "fork.ih"

    void Fork::fork()
    {
        if ((d_pid = ::fork()) &lt; 0)
            throw "Fork::fork() failed";

        if (d_pid == 0)                 // childprocess has pid == 0
        {
            childRedirections();
            childProcess();
            exit(1);                    // we shouldn't come here:
        }                               // childProcess() should exit

        parentRedirections();
        parentProcess();
    }
</pre>
<p>
In <code >fork.cc</code> the class's <a name="an3322"></a><em >internal header file</em> <code >fork.ih</code> is
included. This header file takes care of the inclusion of the necessary system
header files, as well as the inclusion of <code >fork.h</code> itself. Its
implementation is:
        <pre>
    #include "fork.h"
    #include &lt;cstdlib&gt;
    #include &lt;unistd.h&gt;
    #include &lt;sys/types.h&gt;
    #include &lt;sys/wait.h&gt;
</pre>
<p>
Child processes should not return: once they have completed their tasks,
they should terminate. This happens automatically when the child process
performs a call to a member of the <a name="an3323"></a><code >exec...</code> family, but if the child
itself remains active, then it must make sure that it terminates properly. A
child process normally uses <a name="an3324"></a><code >exit</code> to terminate itself, but note that
<code >exit</code> prevents the activation of destructors of objects
        <a name="an3325"></a>
        <a name="an3326"></a>
    defined at the same or more superficial nesting levels than the level at
which <code >exit</code> is called. Destructors of globally defined objects <em >are</em>
activated when <code >exit</code> is used. When using <code >exit</code> to terminate
<code >childProcess</code>, it should either itself call a support member function
defining all nested objects it needs, or it should define all its objects in a
compound statement (e.g., using a <code >throw</code> block) calling <code >exit</code> beyond
the compound statement.
<p>
Parent processes should normally wait for their children to complete.
Terminating child processes inform their parents that they are about to
terminate by sending a <a name="an3327"></a><em >signal</em> that should be caught by their parents.  If
child processes terminate and their parent processes do not catch those
signals then such child processes remain visible as so-called <a name="an3328"></a><em >zombie</em>
processes.
<p>
If parent processes must wait for their children to complete, they may
call the member <code >waitForChild</code>. This member returns the exit status of a
child process to its parent.
<p>
There exists a situation where the <em >child</em> process <em >continues</em> to
live, but the <em >parent</em> dies. This is a fairly natural event: parents tend to
die before their children do. In our context (i.e. <strong >C++</strong>), this is called a
<a name="an3329"></a><em >daemon</em> program. In a daemon the parent process dies and the child program
continues to run as a child of the basic <a name="an3330"></a><code >init</code> process. Again, when the
child eventually dies a signal is sent to its `step-parent' <a name="an3331"></a><code >init</code>. This
does not create a zombie as <code >init</code> catches the termination signals of all
its (step-) children.  The construction of a daemon process is very simple,
given the availability of the class <code >Fork</code> (cf. section <a href="cplusplus24.html#DAEMON">24.2.4</a>).
<p>
<a name="REDIRECTION"></a><a name="l643"></a>
<h3 >24.2.3: Redirection revisited</h3>
        Earlier, in section <a href="cplusplus06.html#REDIR">6.6.2</a> streams were <a name="an3332"></a> redirected
using the <a name="an3333"></a><code >ios::rdbuf</code> member function. By assigning the
<code >streambuf</code> of a stream to another stream, both stream objects access the
same <code >streambuf</code>, thus implementing redirection at the level of the
programming language itself.
<p>
This may be fine within the context of a <strong >C++</strong> program, but once we
leave that context the redirection terminates.  The operating system does not
know about <code >streambuf</code> objects. This situation is encountered, e.g., when a
program uses a <a name="an3334"></a><code >system</code> call to start a subprogram. The example program at
the end of this section uses <strong >C++</strong> redirection to redirect the information
inserted into <a name="an3335"></a><code >cout</code> to a file, and then calls
        <pre>
    system("echo hello world")
</pre>
    to echo a well-known line of text. Since <code >echo</code> writes its information
to the standard output, this would be the program's redirected file if the
operating system would recognize <strong >C++</strong>'s redirection.
<p>
But redirection doesn't happen. Instead, <code >hello world</code> still appears at
the program's standard output and the redirected file is left untouched.  To
write <code >hello world</code> to the redirected file redirection must be realized at
the operating system level.  Some operating systems (e.g., <a name="an3336"></a>Unix and
friends) provide system calls like <a name="an3337"></a><code >dup</code> and <a name="an3338"></a><code >dup2</code> to accomplish
this. Examples of the use of these system calls are given in section
<a href="cplusplus24.html#PIPE">24.2.5</a>.
<p>
Here is the example of the <em >failing redirection</em> at the system level
following  <strong >C++</strong> redirection using <code >streambuf</code> redirection:
        <pre>
    #include &lt;iostream&gt;
    #include &lt;fstream&gt;
    #include &lt;cstdlib&gt;
    using namespace std;

    int main()
    {
        ofstream of("outfile");

        streambuf *buf = cout.rdbuf(of.rdbuf());
        cout &lt;&lt; "To the of stream\n";
        system("echo hello world");
        cout &lt;&lt; "To the of stream\n";
        cout.rdbuf(buf);
    }
    /*
        Generated output: on the file `outfile'

        To the of stream
        To the of stream

        On standard output:

        hello world
    */
</pre>
<p>
<a name="DAEMON"></a><a name="l644"></a>
<h3 >24.2.4: The `Daemon' program</h3>
        Applications exist in which the only purpose of <a name="an3339"></a><code >fork</code> is to start a
child process. The parent process terminates immediately after spawning the
child process. If this happens, the child process continues to run as a child
process of <a name="an3340"></a><code >init</code>, the always running first process on <a name="an3341"></a>Unix systems. Such
a process is often called a <a name="an3342"></a><em >daemon</em>, running as a <a name="an3343"></a>background process.
<p>
Although the next example can easily be constructed as a plain <strong >C</strong>
program, it was included in the <strong >C++</strong> Annotations because it is so closely
related to the current discussion of the <code >Fork</code> class. I thought about
adding a <code >daemon</code> member to that class, but eventually decided against it
because the construction of a daemon program is very simple and requires no
features other than those currently offered by the class <code >Fork</code>.  Here is an
example illustrating the construction of such a daemon program. Its child
process doesn't do <a name="an3344"></a><code >exit</code> but <code >throw 0</code> which is caught by the <code >catch</code>
clause of the child's <code >main</code> function. Doing this ensures that any objects
defined by the child process are properly destroyed:
        <pre>
    #include &lt;iostream&gt;
    #include &lt;unistd.h&gt;
    #include "fork.h"

    class Daemon: public Fork
    {
        virtual void parentProcess()        // the parent does nothing.
        {}
        virtual void childProcess()         // actions by the child
        {
            sleep(3);
                                            // just a message...
            std::cout &lt;&lt; "Hello from the child process\n";
            throw 0;                        // The child process ends
        }
    };

    int main()
    try
    {
        Daemon().fork();
    }
    catch(...)
    {}

    /*
        Generated output:
    The next command prompt, then after 3 seconds:
    Hello from the child process
    */

<h3 >24.2.5: The class `Pipe'</h3>
        Redirection at the system level requires the use of <a name="an3345"></a><em >file descriptors</em>,
created by the <a name="an3346"></a><code >pipe</code> system call. When two processes want to communicate
using such file descriptors, the following happens:
    <ul>
    <li> The process constructs two <em >associated file descriptors</em> using the
<code >pipe</code> system call. One of the file descriptors is used for writing, the
other file descriptor is used for reading.
    <li> Forking takes place (i.e., the system <code >fork</code> function is called),
duplicating the file descriptors. Now we have four file descriptors as
the child process and the parent process both have their own copies of the two
file descriptors created by <code >pipe</code>.
    <li> One process (say, the parent process) uses the file descriptors
for <em >reading</em>. It should close its file descriptor intended for <em >writing</em>.
    <li> The other process (say, the child process) uses the file descriptors
for <em >writing</em>. It should therefore close its file descriptor intended for
<em >reading</em>.
    <li> All information written by the child process to the file
descriptor intended for writing, can now be read by the parent process from
the corresponding file descriptor intended for reading, thus establishing a
communication channel between the child and the parent process.
    </ul>
    Though basically simple, errors may easily creep in. Functions of file
descriptors available to the two processes (child or parent) may easily get
mixed up. To prevent bookkeeping errors, the bookkeeping may be properly set
up once, to be hidden thereafter inside a class like the <code >Pipe</code> class
developed here. Let's have a look at its characteristics (before using
functions like <code >pipe</code> and <code >dup</code> the compiler must have read the
<a name="an3347"></a><code >&lt;unistd.h&gt;</code> header file):
    <ul>
    <li> The <code >pipe</code> system call expects a pointer to two <code >int</code> values,
representing, respectively, the file descriptor used for reading and the file
descriptor used for writing. To avoid confusion, the class <code >Pipe</code> defines an
<code >enum</code> having values associating the indices of the array of 2-<code >int</code>s with
symbolic constants. The two file descriptors themselves are stored in a data
member <code >d_fd</code>. Here is the initial section of the class's interface:
        <pre>
    class Pipe
    {
        enum    RW { READ, WRITE };
        int     d_fd[2];
</pre>
<p>
<li> The class only needs a default constructor. This constructor
calls <code >pipe</code> to create  a set of associated file descriptors used for
accessing both ends of a pipe:
        <pre>
    Pipe::Pipe()
    {
        if (pipe(d_fd))
            throw "Pipe::Pipe(): pipe() failed";
    }
</pre>
<p>
<li> The members <code >readOnly</code> and <code >readFrom</code> are used to configure the
pipe's reading end. The latter function is used when using redirection. It is
provided with an alternate file descriptor to be used for  reading from the
pipe. Usually this alternate file descriptor is <a name="an3348"></a><code >STDIN_FILENO</code>, allowing
<code >cin</code> to extract information from the pipe.  The former function is merely
used to configure the reading end of the pipe. It closes the matching writing
end and returns a file descriptor that can be used to read from the pipe:
        <pre>
    int Pipe::readOnly()
    {
        close(d_fd[WRITE]);
        return d_fd[READ];
    }
    void Pipe::readFrom(int fd)
    {
        readOnly();

        redirect(d_fd[READ], fd);
        close(d_fd[READ]);
    }
</pre>
<p>
<li> <code >writeOnly</code> and two <code >writtenBy</code> members are available to
configure the writing end of a pipe. The former function is only used to
configure the writing end of the pipe. It closes the reading end, and
returns a file descriptor that can be used for writing to the pipe:
        <pre>
    int Pipe::writeOnly()
    {
        close(d_fd[READ]);
        return d_fd[WRITE];
    }
    void Pipe::writtenBy(int fd)
    {
        writtenBy(&amp;fd, 1);
    }
    void Pipe::writtenBy(int const *fd, size_t n)
    {
        writeOnly();

        for (size_t idx = 0; idx &lt; n; idx++)
            redirect(d_fd[WRITE], fd[idx]);

        close(d_fd[WRITE]);
    }
</pre>
<p>
For the latter member two overloaded versions are available:
        <ul>
        <li><code >writtenBy(int fd)</code> is used to configure <em >single</em>
redirection, so that a specific file descriptor (usually <a name="an3349"></a><code >STDOUT_FILENO</code>
or <a name="an3350"></a><code >STDERR_FILENO</code>) can be used to write to the pipe;
        <li><code >(writtenBy(int const *fd, size_t n))</code> may be used
to configure <em >multiple</em> redirection, providing an array argument containing
file descriptors. Information written to any of these file descriptors is
actually written to the pipe.
        </ul>
    <li> The class has one private data member, <code >redirect</code>, used to set up
redirection through the <a name="an3351"></a><code >dup2</code> system call. This function expects two file
descriptors. The first file descriptor represents a file descriptor that can
be used to access the device's information; the second file descriptor is an
alternate file descriptor that may also be used to access the device's
information. Here is <code >redirect</code>'s implementation:
        <pre>
    void Pipe::redirect(int d_fd, int alternateFd)
    {
        if (dup2(d_fd, alternateFd) &lt; 0)
            throw "Pipe: redirection failed";
    }
</pre>
<p>
</ul>
    Now that redirection can be configured easily using one or more <code >Pipe</code>
objects, we'll use <code >Fork</code> and <code >Pipe</code> in various example programs.
<p>
<a name="l646"></a>
<h3 >24.2.6: The class `ParentSlurp'</h3>
        The class <a name="an3352"></a><code >ParentSlurp</code>, derived from <code >Fork</code>, starts a child process
executing a stand-alone program (like <code >/bin/ls</code>). The (standard) output of
the executed program is not shown on the screen but is read by the parent
process.
<p>
For demonstration purposes the parent process writes the lines it
receives to its standard output stream, prepending linenumbers to the
lines. It is attractive to redirect the parent's standard <em >input</em> stream to
allow the parent to read the <em >output</em> from the child process using its
<code >std::cin</code> <em >input</em> stream. Therefore, the only pipe in the program is used
as an <em >input</em> pipe for the parent, and an <em >output</em> pipe for the child.
<p>
The class <code >ParentSlurp</code> has the following characteristics:
    <ul>
    <li> It is derived from <code >Fork</code>. Before starting <code >ParentSlurp</code>'s class
interface, the compiler must have read <code >fork.h</code> and <code >pipe.h</code>. The class
only uses one data member, a <code >Pipe</code> object <code >d_pipe</code>.
    <li> As <code >Pipe</code>'s constructor already defines a pipe, and as <code >d_pipe</code>
is automatically initialized by <code >ParentSlurp</code>'s default constructor, which
is implicitly provided, all additional members only exist for
<code >ParentSlurp</code>'s own benefit so they can be defined in the class's (implicit)
<code >private</code> section. Here is the class's interface:
        <pre>
    class ParentSlurp: public Fork
    {
        Pipe    d_pipe;

        virtual void childRedirections();
        virtual void parentRedirections();
        virtual void childProcess();
        virtual void parentProcess();
    };
</pre>
<p>
<li> The <code >childRedirections</code> member configures the writing end of the
pipe. So, all information written to the child's standard output stream ends
up in the pipe. The big advantage of this is that no additional streams are
needed to write to a file descriptor:
        <pre>
    inline void ParentSlurp::childRedirections()
    {
        d_pipe.writtenBy(STDOUT_FILENO);
    }
</pre>
<p>
<li> The <code >parentRedirections</code> member, configures the reading end of
the pipe. It does so by connecting the reading end of the pipe to the parent's
standard input file descriptor (<code >STDIN_FILENO</code>). This allows the parent to
perform extractions from <code >cin</code>, not requiring any additional streams for
reading.
        <pre>
    inline void ParentSlurp::parentRedirections()
    {
        d_pipe.readFrom(STDIN_FILENO);
    }
</pre>
<p>
<li> The <code >childProcess</code> member only needs to concentrate on its own
actions. As it only needs to execute a program (writing information to its
standard output), the member can consist of  one single statement:
        <pre>
    inline void ParentSlurp::childProcess()
    {
        execl("/bin/ls", "/bin/ls", 0);
    }
</pre>
<p>
<li> The <code >parentProcess</code> member simply `slurps' the information
appearing at its standard input. Doing so, it actually reads the child's
output. It copies the received lines to its standard output stream prefixing
line numbers to them:
        <pre>
    void ParentSlurp::parentProcess()
    {
        std::string     line;
        size_t    nr = 1;

        while (getline(std::cin, line))
            std::cout &lt;&lt; nr++ &lt;&lt; ": " &lt;&lt; line &lt;&lt; '\n';

        waitForChild();
    }
</pre>
<p>
</ul>
    The following program simply constructs a <code >ParentSlurp</code> object, and
calls its <code >fork()</code> member. Its output consists of a numbered list of files
in the directory where the program is started.  Note that the program also
needs the <code >fork.o, pipe.o</code> and <code >waitforchild.o</code> object files (see
earlier sources):
        <pre>
    int main()
    {
        ParentSlurp().fork();
    }
    /*
        Generated Output (example only, actually obtained output may differ):

        1: a.out
        2: bitand.h
        3: bitfunctional
        4: bitnot.h
        5: daemon.cc
        6: fdinseek.cc
        7: fdinseek.h
        ...
    */
</pre>
<p>
<a name="l647"></a>
<h3 >24.2.7: Communicating with multiple children</h3>
        The next step up the ladder is the construction of a child-process
monitor. Here, the parent process is responsible for all its child processes,
but it also must read their standard output. The user enters information at
the standard input of the parent process. A simple <a name="an3353"></a><em >command language</em> is
used for this:
    <ul>
    <li><code >start</code>: this starts a new child process. The parent returns the
child's ID (a number) to the user. The ID is thereupon be used to identify a
particular child process;
    <li><code >&lt;nr&gt; text</code> sends ``<code >text</code>'' to the child process having ID
<code >&lt;nr&gt;</code>;
    <li><code >stop &lt;nr&gt;</code> terminates the child process having ID <code >&lt;nr&gt;</code>;
    <li><code >exit</code> terminates the parent as well as all its child processes.
    </ul>
    If a child process hasn't received text for some time it will complain by
sending a message to the parent-process. Those messages are simply transmitted
to the user by copying them to the standard output stream.
<p>
A problem with programs like our monitor is that they allow
        <a name="an3354"></a><em >asynchronous input</em> from multiple sources. Input may appear at the
standard input as well as at the input-sides of pipes. Also, multiple output
channels are used. To handle situations like these, the <a name="an3355"></a><code >select</code> system
call was developed.
<p>
<a name="l648"></a>
<h4>24.2.7.1: The class `Selector': interface</h4>
            The <a name="an3356"></a><code >select</code> system call was developed to handle asynchronous
        <a name="an3357"></a><a name="an3358"></a><em >I/O multiplexing</em>.
    The <code >select</code> system call is used to handle, e.g., input appearing
simultaneously at a set of file descriptors.
<p>
The <code >select</code> function is rather complex, and its full discussion is
beyond the <strong >C++</strong> Annotations' scope.  By encapsulating <code >select</code> in a <code >class
Selector</code>, hiding its details and offering an intuitively attractive
interface, its use is simplified. The <code >Selector</code> class has these
features:
    <ul>
    <li> Efficiency. As most of <code >Select</code>'s members are very small,
most members can be implemented  inline. The class requires quite a few data
members. Most of these data members belong to types that require some system
headers to be included first:
        <pre>
    #include &lt;limits.h&gt;
    #include &lt;unistd.h&gt;
    #include &lt;sys/time.h&gt;
    #include &lt;sys/types.h&gt;
</pre>
<p>
<li> The class interface can now be defined. The data type <code >fd_set</code> is a
type designed to be used by <code >select</code> and variables of this type contain the
set of file descriptors on which <code >select</code> may sense some
activity. Furthermore, <code >select</code> allows us to fire an
        <a name="an3359"></a><em >asynchronous alarm</em>. To set the alarm time, the class <code >Selector</code>
defines a <a name="an3360"></a><code >timeval</code> data member. Other members are used for internal
bookkeeping purposes. Here is the class <code >Selector</code>'s interface:
        <pre>
    class Selector
    {
        fd_set          d_read;
        fd_set          d_write;
        fd_set          d_except;
        fd_set          d_ret_read;
        fd_set          d_ret_write;
        fd_set          d_ret_except;
        timeval         d_alarm;
        int             d_max;
        int             d_ret;
        int             d_readidx;
        int             d_writeidx;
        int             d_exceptidx;

        public:
            Selector();

            int exceptFd();
            int nReady();
            int readFd();
            int wait();
            int writeFd();
            void addExceptFd(int fd);
            void addReadFd(int fd);
            void addWriteFd(int fd);
            void noAlarm();
            void rmExceptFd(int fd);
            void rmReadFd(int fd);
            void rmWriteFd(int fd);
            void setAlarm(int sec, int usec = 0);

        private:
            int checkSet(int *index, fd_set &amp;set);
            void addFd(fd_set *set, int fd);
    };
</pre>
<p>
</ul>
<p>
<a name="l649"></a>
<h4>24.2.7.2: The class `Selector': implementation</h4>
            Selector's member functions serve the following tasks:
    <ul>
    <li><a name="an3361"></a><code >Selector()</code>: the (default) constructor. It
clears the read, write, and execute <code >fd_set</code> variables, and switches off the
alarm. Except for <code >d_max</code>, the remaining data members do not require
specific initializations:
        <pre>
    Selector::Selector()
    {
        FD_ZERO(&amp;d_read);
        FD_ZERO(&amp;d_write);
        FD_ZERO(&amp;d_except);
        noAlarm();
        d_max = 0;
    }
</pre>
<p>
<li><a name="an3362"></a><code >int wait()</code>: this member <em >blocks</em> until the <em >alarm</em> times
out or until activity is sensed at any of the file descriptors monitored by
the <code >Selector</code> object. It throws an exception when the <code >select</code> system
call itself fails:
        <pre>
    int Selector::wait()
    {
        timeval t = d_alarm;

        d_ret_read = d_read;
        d_ret_write = d_write;
        d_ret_except = d_except;

        d_readidx = 0;
        d_writeidx = 0;
        d_exceptidx = 0;

        d_ret = select(d_max, &amp;d_ret_read, &amp;d_ret_write, &amp;d_ret_except,
                       t.tv_sec == -1 &amp;&amp; t.tv_usec == -1 ? 0 : &amp;t);

        if (d_ret &lt; 0)
            throw "Selector::wait()/select() failed";

        return d_ret;
    }
</pre>
<p>
<li><a name="an3363"></a><code >int nReady</code>: this member function's return value is only
defined when <code >wait</code> has returned. In that case it returns 0 for an
alarm-timeout, -1 if <code >select</code> failed, and otherwise the number of file
descriptors on which activity was sensed:
        <pre>
    inline int Selector::nReady()
    {
        return d_ret;
    }
</pre>
<p>
<li><a name="an3364"></a><code >int readFd()</code>: this member function's return
value is also only defined after <code >wait</code> has returned. Its return value is
-1 if no (more) input file descriptors are available. Otherwise the next file
descriptor available for reading is returned:
        <pre>
    inline int Selector::readFd()
    {
        return checkSet(&amp;d_readidx, d_ret_read);
    }
</pre>
<p>
<li><a name="an3365"></a><code >int writeFd()</code>: operating analogously to <code >readFd</code>, it
returns the next file descriptor to which output is written.  It uses
<code >d_writeidx</code> and <code >d_ret_read</code> and is implemented analogously to
<code >readFd</code>;
    <li><a name="an3366"></a><code >int exceptFd()</code>: operating analogously to <code >readFd</code>, it
returns the next exception file descriptor on which activity was sensed.  It
uses <code >d_except_idx</code> and <code >d_ret_except</code> and is implemented analogously to
<code >readFd</code>;
    <li><a name="an3367"></a><code >void setAlarm(int sec, int usec = 0)</code>: this member
activates <code >Select</code>'s alarm facility. At least the number of seconds to wait
for the alarm to go off must be specified. It simply assigns values to
<code >d_alarm</code>'s fields. At the next <code >Select::wait</code> call, the alarm fires
(i.e., <code >wait</code> returns with return value 0) once the configured
alarm-interval has passed:
        <pre>
    inline void Selector::setAlarm(int sec, int usec)
    {
        d_alarm.tv_sec  = sec;
        d_alarm.tv_usec = usec;
    }
</pre>
<p>
<li><a name="an3368"></a><code >void noAlarm()</code>: this member switches off the alarm, by
simply setting the alarm interval to a very long period:
        <pre>
    inline void Selector::noAlarm()
    {
        setAlarm(-1, -1);
    }
</pre>
<p>
<li><a name="an3369"></a><code >void addReadFd(int fd)</code>: this member adds a
file descriptor to the set of input file descriptors monitored by the
<code >Selector</code> object. The member function <code >wait</code> returns once input is
available at the indicated file descriptor:
        <pre>
    inline void Selector::addReadFd(int fd)
    {
        addFd(&amp;d_read, fd);
    }
</pre>
<p>
<li><a name="an3370"></a><code >void addWriteFd(int fd)</code>: this member adds a file
descriptor to the set of output file descriptors monitored by the <code >Selector</code>
object. The member function <code >wait</code> returns once output is available at
the indicated file descriptor. Using <code >d_write</code>, it is implemented
analogously to <code >addReadFd</code>;
    <li><a name="an3371"></a><code >void addExceptFd(int fd)</code>: this member adds a file
descriptor to the set of exception file descriptors to be monitored by the
<code >Selector</code> object.  The member function <code >wait</code> returns once activity
is sensed at the indicated file descriptor. Using <code >d_except</code>, it is
implemented analogously to <code >addReadFd</code>;
    <li><a name="an3372"></a><code >void rmReadFd(int fd)</code>: this member removes a file
descriptor from the set of input file descriptors monitored by the
<code >Selector</code> object:
        <pre>
    inline void Selector::rmReadFd(int fd)
    {
        FD_CLR(fd, &amp;d_read);
    }
</pre>
<p>
<li><a name="an3373"></a><code >void rmWriteFd(int fd)</code>: this member removes a file
descriptor from the set of output file descriptors monitored by the
<code >Selector</code> object.  Using <code >d_write</code>, it is implemented analogously to
<code >rmReadFd</code>;
    <li><a name="an3374"></a><code >void rmExceptFd(int fd)</code>: this member removes a file
descriptor from the set of exception file descriptors to be monitored by the
<code >Selector</code> object.  Using <code >d_except</code>, it is implemented analogously to
<code >rmReadFd</code>;
    </ul>
    The class's remaining (two) members are support members, and should not be
used by non-member functions. Therefore, they are declared in the class's
<code >private</code> section:
    <ul>
    <li> The member <code >addFd</code> adds a file descriptor to a <code >fd_set</code>:
        <pre>
    void Selector::addFd(fd_set *set, int fd)
    {
        FD_SET(fd, set);
        if (fd &gt;= d_max)
            d_max = fd + 1;
    }
</pre>
<p>
<li> The member <code >checkSet</code> tests whether a file descriptor (<code >*index</code>)
is found in a <code >fd_set</code>:
        <pre>

<h4>24.2.7.3: The class `Monitor': interface</h4>
            The <code >monitor</code> program uses a <code >Monitor</code> object doing most of the
work. The class <code >Monitor</code>'s public interface only offers a default
constructor and one member, <code >run</code>, to perform its tasks.  All other member
functions are located in the class's <code >private</code> section.
<p>
<code >Monitor</code> defines the <code >private</code> enum <code >Commands</code>, symbolically
listing the various commands its input language supports, as well as several
data members.  Among the data members are a <code >Selector</code> object and a <code >map</code>
using child order numbers as its keys and pointer to <code >Child</code> objects (see
section <a href="cplusplus24.html#CHILD">24.2.7.7</a>) as its values. Furthermore, <code >Monitor</code> has a static array
member <code >s_handler[]</code>, storing pointers to member functions handling user
commands.
<p>
A destructor should be implemented as well, but its implementation is left
as an exercise to the reader. Here is <code >Monitor</code>'s interface, including the
interface of the nested class <code >Find</code> that is used to create a function
object:
        <pre>
    class Monitor
    {
        enum Commands
        {
            UNKNOWN,
            START,
            EXIT,
            STOP,
            TEXT,
            sizeofCommands
        };

        typedef std::map&lt;int, std::shared_ptr&lt;Child&gt;&gt; MapIntChild;

        friend class Find;
        class Find
        {
            int     d_nr;
            public:
                Find(int nr);
                bool operator()(MapIntChild::value_type &amp;vt) const;
        };

        Selector    d_selector;
        int         d_nr;
        MapIntChild d_child;

        static void (Monitor::*s_handler[])(int, std::string const &amp;);
        static int s_initialize;

        public:
            enum Done
            {};

            Monitor();
            void run();

        private:
            static void killChild(MapIntChild::value_type it);
            static int initialize();

            Commands    next(int *value, std::string *line);
            void    processInput();
            void    processChild(int fd);

            void    createNewChild(int, std::string const &amp;);
            void    exiting(int = 0, std::string const &amp;msg = std::string());
            void    sendChild(int value, std::string const &amp;line);
            void    stopChild(int value, std::string const &amp;);
            void    unknown(int, std::string const &amp;);
    };
</pre>
<p>
Since there's only one non-class type data member, the class's constructor
is a very simple function which could be implemented inline:
        <pre>
    inline Monitor::Monitor()
    :
        d_nr(0)
    {}
</pre>
<p>
<a name="l651"></a>
<h4>24.2.7.4: The class `Monitor': s_handler</h4>
        The array
<code >s_handler</code>, storing pointers to functions needs to be initialized as
well. This can be accomplished in several ways:
    <ul>
    <li> Since the <code >Commands</code> enumeration only specifies a fairly limited
set of commands, compile-time initialization could be considered:
        <pre>
    void (Monitor::*Monitor::s_handler[])(int, string const &amp;)  =
    {
        &amp;Monitor::unknown,              // order follows enum Command's
        &amp;Monitor::createNewChild,       // elements
        &amp;Monitor::exiting,
        &amp;Monitor::stopChild,
        &amp;Monitor::sendChild,
    };
</pre>
<p>
The advantage of this is that it's simple, not requiring any run-time
effort. The disadvantage is of course relatively complex maintenance. If for
some reason <code >Commands</code> is modified, <code >s_handler</code> must be modified as
well. In cases like these, compile-time initialization often is
asking for trouble. There is a simple alternative though.
    <li> Looking at <code >Monitor</code>'s interface we see a static data member
<code >s_initialize</code> and a static member function <code >initialize</code>. The static
member function handles the initialization of the <code >s_handler</code> array. It
explicitly assigns the array's elements and any modification in ordering of
<code >enum Commands</code>' values is automatically accounted for by recompiling
<code >initialize</code>:
        <pre>
    void (Monitor::*Monitor::s_handler[sizeofCommands])(int, string const &amp;);

    int Monitor::initialize()
    {
        s_handler[UNKNOWN] =    &amp;Monitor::unknown;
        s_handler[START] =      &amp;Monitor::createNewChild;
        s_handler[EXIT] =       &amp;Monitor::exiting;
        s_handler[STOP] =       &amp;Monitor::stopChild;
        s_handler[TEXT] =       &amp;Monitor::sendChild;
        return 0;
    }
</pre>
<p>
The member <code >initialize</code> is a static member and so it can be
called to initialize <code >s_initialize</code>, a static <code >int</code> variable. The
initialization is enforced by placing the initialization statement in the
source file of a function that is known to be executed. It could be <code >main</code>,
but if we're <code >Monitor</code>'s maintainers and only have control over the library
containing <code >Monitor</code>'s code then that's not an option. In those cases the
source file containing the destructor is a <em >very</em> good candidate. If a class
has only one constructor and it's <em >not</em> defined inline then the
constructor's source file is a good candidate as well. In <code >Monitor</code>'s
current implementation the initialization statement is put in <code >run</code>'s source
file, reasoning that <code >s_handler</code> is only needed when <code >run</code> is used.
    </ul>
<p>
<a name="l652"></a>
<h4>24.2.7.5: The class `Monitor': the member `run'</h4>
            <code >Monitor</code>'s core activities are performed by <code >run</code>. It
performs the following tasks:
    <ul>
    <li> Initially, the <code >Monitor</code> object only monitors its standard
input. The set of input file descriptors to which <code >d_selector</code> listens
is initialized to <code >STDIN_FILENO</code>.
    <li> Then, in a loop  <code >d_selector</code>'s <code >wait</code> function is called.
If input on <code >cin</code> is available, it is processed by <code >processInput</code>.
Otherwise, the input has arrived from a child process. Information sent by
children is processed by <code >processChild</code>.
    <li> To prevent <a name="an3375"></a><em >zombie</em><em >s</em>, the child processes must catch <em >their</em>
children's termination signals. This is discussed below.
<p>
As noted by Ben Simons (<code >ben at mrxfx dot com</code>) <code >Monitor</code> must not catch
the termination signals.  Instead, the process spawning child processes has
that responsibility (the underlying principle being that a parent process is
responsible for its child processes; a child process, in turn, is responsible
for its own child processes).
    <li> As stated, <code >run</code>'s source file also defines and initializes
<code >s_initialize</code> to ensure the proper initialization of the <code >s_handler</code>
array.
    </ul>
    Here is <code >run</code>'s implementation and <code >s_initialize</code>'s definition:
        <pre>
    #include "monitor.ih"

    int Monitor::s_initialize = Monitor::initialize();

    void Monitor::run()
    {
        d_selector.addReadFd(STDIN_FILENO);

        while (true)
        {
            cout &lt;&lt; "? " &lt;&lt; flush;
            try
            {
                d_selector.wait();

                int fd;
                while ((fd = d_selector.readFd()) != -1)
                {
                    if (fd == STDIN_FILENO)
                        processInput();
                    else
                        processChild(fd);
                }
                cout &lt;&lt; "NEXT ...\n";
            }
            catch (char const *msg)
            {
                exiting(1, msg);
            }
        }
    }
</pre>
<p>
The member function <code >processInput</code> reads the commands entered by the
user using the program's standard input stream. The member itself is rather
simple. It calls <code >next</code> to obtain the next command entered by the user, and
then calls the corresponding function using the matching element of the
<code >s_handler[]</code> array. Here are the members <code >processInput</code> and <code >next</code>:
        <pre>
    void Monitor::processInput()
    {
        string line;
        int    value;
        Commands cmd = next(&amp;value, &amp;line);
        (this-&gt;*s_handler[cmd])(value, line);
    }
</pre>
<p>
<pre>
    Monitor::Commands Monitor::next(int *value, string *line)
    {
        if (!getline(cin, *line))
            exiting(1, "Monitor::next(): reading cin failed");

        if (*line == "start")
            return START;

        if (*line == "exit" || *line == "quit")
        {
            *value = 0;
            return EXIT;
        }

        if (line-&gt;find("stop") == 0)
        {
            istringstream istr(line-&gt;substr(4));
            istr &gt;&gt; *value;
            return !istr ? UNKNOWN : STOP;
        }

        istringstream istr(line-&gt;c_str());
        istr &gt;&gt; *value;
        if (istr)
        {
            getline(istr, *line);
            return TEXT;
        }

        return UNKNOWN;
    }
</pre>
<p>
All other input sensed by <code >d_select</code> is created by child
processes. Because <code >d_select</code>'s <code >readFd</code> member returns the corresponding
input file descriptor, this descriptor can be passed to
<code >processChild</code>. Using a <a name="an3376"></a><code >IFdStreambuf</code> (see section <a href="cplusplus24.html#IFDBUF">24.1.2.1</a>), its
information is read from an input stream. The communication protocol used here
is rather basic. For every line of input sent to a child, the child replies by
sending back exactly one line of text. This line is then read by
<code >processChild</code>:
        <pre>
    void Monitor::processChild(int fd)
    {
        IFdStreambuf ifdbuf(fd);
        istream istr(&amp;ifdbuf);
        string line;

        getline(istr, line);
        cout &lt;&lt; d_child[fd]-&gt;pid() &lt;&lt; ": " &lt;&lt; line &lt;&lt; '\n';
    }
</pre>
<p>
The construction <code >d_child[fd]-&gt;pid()</code> used in the above source deserves
some special attention. <code >Monitor</code> defines the data member <code >map&lt;int,
shared_ptr&lt;Child&gt;&gt; d_child</code>.  This map contains the child's order number
as its key, and a (shared) pointer to the <code >Child</code> object as its value. A
shared pointer is used here, rather than a <code >Child</code> object, since we want to
use the facilities offered by the map, but don't want to copy a <code >Child</code>
object time and again.
<p>
<a name="l653"></a>
<h4>24.2.7.6: The class `Monitor': example</h4>
            Now that <code >run</code>'s implementation has been covered, we'll concentrate on
the various commands users might enter:
    <ul>
    <li> When the <code >start</code> command is issued, a new child process is started.
A new element is added to <code >d_child</code> by the member <code >createNewChild</code>.  Next,
the <code >Child</code> object should start its activities, but the <code >Monitor</code> object
can not wait for the child process to complete its activities, as there is no
well-defined endpoint in the near future, and the user probably wants to be
able to enter more commands. Therefore, the <code >Child</code> process must run as a
<a name="an3377"></a><em >daemon</em>. So the forked process terminates immediately, but its own child
process continues to run (in the background). Consequently,
<code >createNewChild</code> calls the child's <code >fork</code> member. Although it is the
child's <code >fork</code> function that is called, it is still the monitor program
wherein that <code >fork</code> function is called. So, the <em >monitor</em> program is
duplicated by <code >fork</code>. Execution then continues:
    <ul>
    <li> At the <code >Child</code>'s <code >parentProcess</code> in its parent process;
    <li> At the <code >Child</code>'s <code >childProcess</code> in its child process
    </ul>
    As the <code >Child</code>'s <code >parentProcess</code> is an empty function, returning
immediately, the <code >Child</code>'s parent process effectively continues immediately
below <code >createNewChild</code>'s <code >cp-&gt;fork()</code> statement.  As the child process
never returns (see section <a href="cplusplus24.html#CHILD">24.2.7.7</a>), the code below <code >cp-&gt;fork()</code> is never
executed by the <code >Child</code>'s child process. This is exactly as it should be.
<p>
In the parent process, <code >createNewChild</code>'s remaining code simply
adds the file descriptor that's available for reading information from the
child to the set of input file descriptors monitored by <code >d_select</code>, and
uses <code >d_child</code> to  establish the association between that
file descriptor and the  <code >Child</code> object's address:
        <pre>
    void Monitor::createNewChild(int, string const &amp;)
    {
        Child *cp = new Child(++d_nr);

        cp-&gt;fork();

        int fd = cp-&gt;readFd();

        d_selector.addReadFd(fd);
        d_child[fd].reset(cp);

        cerr &lt;&lt; "Child " &lt;&lt; d_nr &lt;&lt; " started\n";
    }
</pre>
<p>
<li> Direct communication with the child is required for the <code >stop &lt;nr&gt;</code>
and <code >&lt;nr&gt; text</code> commands. The former command terminates child process
<code >&lt;nr&gt;</code>, by calling <code >stopChild</code>. This function locates the child process
having the order number using an anonymous object of the class <code >Find</code>,
nested inside <code >Monitor</code>. The class <code >Find</code> simply compares the
provided <code >nr</code> with the children's order number returned by their <code >nr</code>
members:
        <pre>
    inline Monitor::Find::Find(int nr)
    :
        d_nr(nr)
    {}
    inline bool Monitor::Find::operator()(MapIntChild::value_type &amp;vt) const
    {
        return d_nr == vt.second-&gt;nr();
    }
</pre>
<p>
If the child process having order number <code >nr</code> was found, its file
descriptor is removed from <code >d_selector</code>'s set of input file
descriptors. Then the child process itself is terminated by the static member
<code >killChild</code>. The member <code >killChild</code> is declared as a <em >static</em> member
function, as it is used as function argument of the <code >for_each</code> generic
algorithm by <code >exiting</code> (see below). Here is <code >killChild</code>'s
implementation:
        <pre>
    void Monitor::killChild(MapIntChild::value_type it)
    {
        if (kill(it.second-&gt;pid(), SIGTERM))
            cerr &lt;&lt; "Couldn't kill process " &lt;&lt; it.second-&gt;pid() &lt;&lt; '\n';

        // reap defunct child process
        int status = 0;
        while( waitpid( it.second-&gt;pid(), &amp;status, WNOHANG) &gt; -1)
            ;
    }
</pre>
<p>
Having terminated the specified child process, the corresponding <code >Child</code>
object is destroyed and its pointer is removed from <code >d_child</code>:
        <pre>
    void Monitor::stopChild(int nr, string const &amp;)
    {
        auto it = find_if(d_child.begin(), d_child.end(), Find(nr));

        if (it == d_child.end())
            cerr &lt;&lt; "No child number " &lt;&lt; nr &lt;&lt; '\n';
        else
        {
            d_selector.rmReadFd(it-&gt;second-&gt;readFd());
            d_child.erase(it);
        }
    }
</pre>
<p>
<li> The command <code >&lt;nr&gt; text</code> sends <code >text</code> to child process <code >nr</code>
using the member function <code >sendChild</code>. This function also uses a <code >Find</code>
object to locate the child-process having order number <code >nr</code>, and simply
inserts the text into the writing end of a pipe connected to that child
process:
        <pre>
    void Monitor::sendChild(int nr, string const &amp;line)
    {
        auto it = find_if(d_child.begin(), d_child.end(), Find(nr));

        if (it == d_child.end())
            cerr &lt;&lt; "No child number " &lt;&lt; nr &lt;&lt; '\n';
        else
        {
            OFdnStreambuf ofdn(it-&gt;second-&gt;writeFd());
            ostream out(&amp;ofdn);

            out &lt;&lt; line &lt;&lt; '\n';
        }
    }
</pre>
<p>
<li> When users enter <code >exit</code> or <code >quit</code> the member <code >exiting</code> is
called.  It terminates all child processes using the <a name="an3378"></a><code >for_each</code> generic
algorithm (see section <a href="cplusplus19.html#FOREACH">19.1.18</a>) to visit all elements of
<code >d_child</code>. Then the program itself ends:
        <pre>
    void Monitor::exiting(int value, string const &amp;msg)
    {
        for_each(d_child.begin(), d_child.end(), killChild);
        if (msg.length())
            cerr &lt;&lt; msg &lt;&lt; '\n';
        throw value;
    }
</pre>
<p>
</ul>
    The program's <code >main</code> function is simple and needs no further comment:
        <pre>
    int main()
    try
    {
        Monitor().run();
    }
    catch (int exitValue)
    {
        return exitValue;
    }
</pre>
<p>
<a name="CHILD"></a><a name="l654"></a>
<h4>24.2.7.7: The class `Child'</h4>
            When the <code >Monitor</code> object starts a child process, it creates an object
of the class <code >Child</code>. The <code >Child</code> class is derived from the class
<code >Fork</code>, allowing it to operate as a <a name="an3379"></a><em >daemon</em> (as discussed in the
previous section). Since <code >Child</code> is a daemon class, we know that its parent
process must be defined as an empty function.  Its <code >childProcess</code> member
has a non-empty implementation. Here are the characteristics of the class
<code >Child</code>:
    <ul>
    <li> The <code >Child</code> class has two <code >Pipe</code> data members, to handle
communications between its own child- and parent processes. As these pipes are
used by the <code >Child</code>'s child process, their names refer to the child
process. The child process reads from <code >d_in</code>, and writes to <code >d_out</code>. Here
is the interface of the class <code >Child</code>:
        <pre>
    class Child: public Fork
    {
        Pipe                d_in;
        Pipe                d_out;

        int         d_parentReadFd;
        int         d_parentWriteFd;
        int         d_nr;

        public:
            Child(int nr);
            virtual ~Child();
            int readFd() const;
            int writeFd() const;
            int pid() const;
            int nr() const;
        private:
            virtual void childRedirections();
            virtual void parentRedirections();
            virtual void childProcess();
            virtual void parentProcess();
    };
</pre>
<p>
<li> The <code >Child</code>'s constructor simply stores its argument, a
child-process order number, in its own <code >d_nr</code> data member:
        <pre>
    inline Child::Child(int nr)
    :
        d_nr(nr)
    {}
</pre>
<p>
<li> The <code >Child</code>'s child process obtains commands from its standard
input stream and writes its output to its standard output stream. Since the
actual communication channels are pipes, redirections must be used. The
<code >childRedirections</code> member looks like this:
        <pre>
    void Child::childRedirections()
    {
        d_in.readFrom(STDIN_FILENO);
        d_out.writtenBy(STDOUT_FILENO);
    }
</pre>
<p>
<li> Although the parent process performs no actions, it must configure
some redirections. Realizing that the names of the pipes indicate their
functions in the child process. So the parent <em >writes</em> to <code >d_in</code> and
<em >reads</em> from <code >d_out</code>. Here is <code >parentRedirections</code>:
        <pre>
    void Child::parentRedirections()
    {
        d_parentReadFd = d_out.readOnly();
        d_parentWriteFd = d_in.writeOnly();
    }
</pre>
<p>
<li> The <code >Child</code> object exists until it is destroyed by the
<code >Monitor</code>'s <code >stopChild</code> member. By allowing its creator, the <code >Monitor</code>
object, to access the parent-side ends of the pipes, the <code >Monitor</code> object
can communicate with the <code >Child</code>'s child process via those pipe-ends. The
members <code >readFd</code> and <code >writeFd</code> allow the <code >Monitor</code> object to access
these pipe-ends:
        <pre>
    inline int Child::readFd() const
    {
        return d_parentReadFd;
    }
    inline int Child::writeFd() const
    {
        return d_parentWriteFd;

</pre>
<p>
<li> The <code >Child</code> object's child process performs two tasks:
        <ul>
        <li> It must reply to information appearing at its standard input
stream;
        <li> If no information has appeared within a certain time frame (the
implementations uses an interval of five seconds), then a message is written
to its standard output stream.
        </ul>
        To implement this behavior, <code >childProcess</code> defines a local
<code >Selector</code> object, adding <code >STDIN_FILENO</code> to its set of monitored input
file descriptors.
<p>
Then, in an endless loop, <code >childProcess</code> waits for <code >selector.wait()</code>
to return. When the alarm goes off it sends a message to its standard output
(hence, into the writing pipe). Otherwise, it echoes the messages appearing
at its standard input to its standard output. Here is the <code >childProcess</code>
member:
        <pre>
    void Child::childProcess()
    {
        Selector    selector;
        size_t    message = 0;

        selector.addReadFd(STDIN_FILENO);
        selector.setAlarm(5);

        while (true)
        {
            try
            {
                if (!selector.wait())       // timeout
                    cout &lt;&lt; "Child " &lt;&lt; d_nr &lt;&lt; ": standing by\n";
                else
                {
                    string  line;
                    getline(cin, line);
                    cout &lt;&lt; "Child " &lt;&lt; d_nr &lt;&lt; ":" &lt;&lt; ++message &lt;&lt; ": " &lt;&lt;
                                                        line &lt;&lt; '\n';
                }
            }
            catch (...)
            {
                    cout &lt;&lt; "Child " &lt;&lt; d_nr &lt;&lt; ":" &lt;&lt; ++message &lt;&lt; ": " &lt;&lt;
                                "select() failed" &lt;&lt; '\n';
            }
        }
        exit(0);
    }
</pre>
<p>
<li> Two accessors are defined allowing the <code >Monitor</code> object to obtain
the <code >Child</code>'s process ID and its order number:
        <pre>
    inline int Child::pid() const
    {
        return Fork::pid();
    }
    inline int Child::nr() const
    {
        return d_nr;
    }
</pre>
<p>
<li> A <code >Child</code> process terminates when the user enters a <code >stop</code>
command. When an existing child process number was entered, the corresponding
<code >Child</code> object is removed from <code >Monitor</code>'s <code >d_child</code> map. As a result,
its destructor is called. <code >Child</code>'s destructor calls <code >kill</code> to terminate
its child, and then waits for the child to terminate. Once its child has
terminated, the destructor has completed its work and returns, thus completing
the erasure from <code >d_child</code>. The current implementation fails if the child
process doesn't react to the <code >SIGTERM</code> signal. In this demonstration program
this does not happen. In `real life' more elaborate killing-procedures may be
required (e.g., using <code >SIGKILL</code> in addition to <code >SIGTERM</code>). As discussed in
section <a href="cplusplus10.html#CONSEXCEPTIONS">10.12</a> it <em >is</em> important to ensure the proper
destruction. Here is the <code >Child</code>'s destructor:
        <pre>
    Child::~Child()
    {
        if (pid())
        {
            cout &lt;&lt; "Killing process " &lt;&lt; pid() &lt;&lt; "\n";
            kill(pid(), SIGTERM);
            int status;
            wait(&amp;status);
        }
    }

<h2 >24.3: Function objects performing bitwise operations</h2>
    In section <a href="cplusplus18.html#PREDEFINED">18.1</a> several <a name="an3380"></a>predefined function objects
were introduced. Predefined function objects performing
    <a name="an3381"></a>arithmetic operations, <a name="an3382"></a>relational operations, and
    <a name="an3383"></a>logical operations exist, corresponding to a multitude of
    <a name="an3384"></a> binary- and <a name="an3385"></a> unary operators.
<p>
Some operators appear to be missing: there appear to be no predefined
function objects corresponding to <a name="an3386"></a>bitwise operations. However, their
construction is, given the available predefined function objects, not
difficult. The following examples show a <a name="an3387"></a>class template implementing a
function object calling the <a name="an3388"></a>bitwise and (<a name="an3389"></a><code >operator&amp;</code>), and a template
class implementing a function object calling the <a name="an3390"></a>unary not
(<a name="an3391"></a><code >operator~</code>). It is left to the reader to construct similar function
objects for other operators.
<p>
Here is the implementation of a function object calling the <a name="an3392"></a>bitwise
<code >operator&amp;</code>:
        <pre>
    #include &lt;functional&gt;

    template &lt;typename _Tp&gt;
    struct bitAnd: public std::binary_function&lt;_Tp, _Tp, _Tp&gt;
    {
        _Tp &amp;&amp;operator()(_Tp const &amp;__x, _Tp const &amp;__y) const
        {
            return std::move(__x &amp; __y);
        }
    };
</pre>
<p>
Here is the implementation of a function object calling <code >operator~()</code>:
        <pre>
    #include &lt;functional&gt;

    template &lt;typename _Tp&gt;
    struct bit_not: public std::unary_function&lt;_Tp, _Tp&gt;
    {
        _Tp &amp;&amp;operator()(_Tp const &amp;__x) const
        {
            return _Tp(~__x);
        }
    };
</pre>
<p>
These and other missing predefined function objects are also implemented
in the file <a name="an3393"></a><code >bitfunctional</code>, which is found in the <code >cplusplus.yo.zip</code>
archive. These classes are derived from existing class templates (e.g.,
 <a name="an3394"></a><code >std::binary_function</code> and
 <a name="an3395"></a><code >std::unary_function</code>). These base classes
 <a name="an3396"></a><a name="an3397"></a> define several types which
are expected (used) by various generic algorithms as defined in the STL
(cf. chapter <a href="cplusplus19.html#GENERIC">19</a>), thus following the advice offered in, e.g., the
<strong >C++</strong> header file <a name="an3398"></a><code >bits/stl_function.h</code>:
        <pre>
   *  The standard functors are derived from structs named unary_function
   *  and binary_function.  These two classes contain nothing but typedefs,
   *  to aid in generic (template) programming.  If you write your own
   *  functors, you might consider doing the same.
</pre>
<p>
Here is an example using <code >bit_and</code>, removing all odd numbers from a
vector of <code >int</code> values:
        <pre>
    #include &lt;iostream&gt;
    #include &lt;algorithm&gt;
    #include &lt;vector&gt;
    #include &lt;iterator&gt;
    #include "bitand.h"
    using namespace std;

    int main()
    {
        vector&lt;int&gt; vi;

        for (int idx = 0; idx &lt; 10; ++idx)
            vi.push_back(idx);

        copy
        (
            vi.begin(),
            remove_if(vi.begin(), vi.end(), bind2nd(bitAnd&lt;int&gt;(), 1)),
            ostream_iterator&lt;int&gt;(cout, " ")
        );
        cout &lt;&lt; '\n';
    }
    /*

<h2 >24.4: Adding binary operators to classes</h2>
As we've seen in section <a href="cplusplus11.html#OVERLOADBINARY">11.6</a> binary operators expecting
<code >const &amp;</code> arguments can be implemented using a member implementing the
operation, only offering the basic exception guarantee.
This latter function can in turn be implemented using the binary
assignment member. The following examples illustrated this approach for a
fictitious class <code >Binary</code>:
        <pre>
    class Binary
    {
        public:
            Binary();
            Binary(int value);
                // copy and move constructors are available by default, or
                // they can be explicitly declared and implemented.

            Binary &amp;operator+=(Binary const &amp;other) &amp;;    // see the text
            Binary &amp;&amp;operator+=(Binary const &amp;other) &amp;&amp;;

        private:
            void add(Binary const &amp;rhs);

        friend Binary operator+(Binary const &amp;lhs, Binary const &amp;rhs);
        friend Binary operator+(Binary &amp;&amp;lhs, Binary const &amp;rhs);
    };
</pre>
<p>
Eventually, the implementation of binary operators depends on the availability
of the member implementing the basic binary operation, modifying the object
calling that member (i.e., <code >void Binary::add(Binary const &amp;)</code> in the
example).
<p>
Since template functions are not instantiated before they are actually used we
can call non-existing functions from template functions that are never
instantiated. If such a template function is never instantiated, nothing
happens; if it is (accidentally) instantiated, then the compiler generates an
error message, complaining about the missing function.
<p>
This allows us to implement all binary operators, movable and non-movable, as
templates. In the following subsections we develop the class template
<code >Binops</code>, prividing binary operators.  A complete implementation of a class
<code >Derived</code> illustrating how addition and insertion operators can be added to
a class is provided in the file
<code >annotations/yo/concrete/examples/binopclasses.cc</code> in the <strong >C++</strong> Annotations'
source archive.
<p>
<a name="l657"></a>
<h3 >24.4.1: Merely using operators</h3>
    In section <a href="cplusplus11.html#OVERLOADBINARY">11.6</a> addition operators are implemented in terms of
a support member <code >add</code>. This is less attractive when developing function
templates, as <code >add</code> is a private member, requiring us to provide friend
declarations for all function templates so they may access the private <code >add</code>
member.
<p>
At the end of section <a href="cplusplus11.html#OVERLOADBINARY">11.6</a> we saw that <code >add's</code> implementation
can be provided by <code >operator+=(Class const &amp;rhs) &amp;&amp;</code>. This operator may
thereupon be used when implementing the remaining addition operators:
        <pre>
    inline Binary &amp;operator+=(Binary const &amp;rhs) &amp;
    {
        return *this = Binary{*this} += rhs;        
    }

    Binary operator+(Binary &amp;&amp;lhs, Binary const &amp;rhs)
    {
        return std::move(lhs) += rhs;
    }

    Binary operator+(Binary const &amp;lhs, Binary const &amp;rhs)
    {
        return Binary{lhs} += rhs;
    }
</pre>
<p>
In this implementation <code >add</code> is no longer required. The plain binary
operators are free functions, which supposedly can easily be converted to
function templates. E.g.,
        <pre>
    template &lt;typename Binary&gt;
    Binary operator+(Binary const &amp;lhs, Binary const &amp;rhs)
    {
        return Binary{lhs} += rhs;
    }
</pre>
<p>
<a name="l658"></a>
<h4>24.4.1.1: To namespace or not to namespace?</h4>
        When using the function template <code >Binary operator+(Binary const &amp;lhs, Binary
const &amp;rhs)</code>, however, we may encounter a subtle and unexpected
complication. Consider the following program. When run, it displays the value
12, rather than 1:
        <pre>
    enum Values
    {
        ZERO,
        ONE
    };
    
    template &lt;typename Tp&gt;
    Tp operator+(Tp const &amp;lhs, Tp const &amp;rhs)
    {
        return static_cast&lt;X&gt;(12);
    };
    
    int main()
    {
        cout &lt;&lt; (ZERO + ONE);       // shows 12
    }
</pre>
    This complication can be avoided by defining the operators in their own
namespace, but then all classes using the binary operator also have to be
defined in that namespace, which is not a very attractive
restriction. Fortunately, there is a better alternative: using the CRTP
(cf. section <a href="cplusplus22.html#STATICPOLY">22.12</a>).
<p>
<a name="l659"></a>
<h3 >24.4.2: The CRTP and defining operator function templates</h3>
    When deriving classes from a class template <code >Binops</code>, using the CRTP the
operators are defined for arguments of the class <code >Binops&lt;Derived&gt;</code>: a base
class receiving the derived class as its template argument. 
<p>
Thus the class <code >Binops</code> as well as the additional operators are defined,
expecting <code >Binops&lt;Derived&gt;</code> type of arguments:
        <pre>
    template &lt;class Derived&gt;
    struct Binops
    {
        Derived &amp;operator+=(Derived const &amp;rhs) &amp;;
    };

    template &lt;typename Derived&gt;
    Derived operator+(Binops&lt;Derived&gt; const &amp;lhs, Derived const &amp;rhs)
    {
        return Derived{static_cast&lt;Derived&gt; const &amp;&gt;(lhs) } += rhs;
    }
    // analogous implementation for Binops&lt;Derived&gt; &amp;&amp;lhs
</pre>
<p>
This way, a class that derives from <code >Binops</code>, and that provides an
<code >operator+=</code> member which is bound to an rvalue reference object, suddenly
also provides all other binary addition operators:
        <pre>
    class Derived: public Binops&lt;Derived&gt;
    {
        ...
        public:
            ...
            Derived &amp;&amp;operator+=(Derived const &amp;rhs) &amp;&amp;
    };
</pre>
    All, but one.... 
<p>
The operator that's not available is the compound addition operator,
bound to an lvalue reference. As its function name is identical to the one in
the class <code >Derived</code>, it is not automatically visible at the user level.
<p>
Although this problem can simply be solved by providing the class <code >Derived</code>
with a <code >using Binops&lt;Derived&gt;::operator+=</code> declaration, it is not a very
attractive solution, as separate using declarations have to be provided for
each binary operator that is implemented in the class <code >Derived</code>.
<p>
But a <em >much</em> more attractive solution exists. A beautiful out-of-the-box
solution, completely avoiding the hidden base class operator, was proposed
by <a name="an3399"></a>Wiebe-Marten Wijnja. Wiebe-Marten conjectured that <code >operator+=</code>, bound
to an lvalue reference could also very well be defined as a <em >free</em>
function. In that case no inheritance is used and therefore no function hiding
occurs. Consequently, the <code >using</code> directive can be avoided. 
<p>
The implementation of this free <code >operator+=</code> function looks like this:
        <pre>
    template &lt;class Derived&gt;
    Derived &amp;operator+=(Binops&lt;Derived&gt; &amp;lhs, Derived const &amp;rhs) 
    {
        Derived tmp{ Derived{ static_cast&lt;Derived &amp;&gt;(lhs) } += rhs };
        tmp.swap(static_cast&lt;Derived &amp;&gt;(lhs));
        return static_cast&lt;Derived &amp;&gt;(lhs);
    }
</pre>
<p>
The flexibility of this design can be further augmented once we realize that
the right-hand side operand doesn't have to be a <code >Derived</code> class
object. Consider <code >operator&lt;&lt;</code>: oftentimes shifts are bit-shifts, using a
<code >size_t</code> to specify the number of bits to shift. In fact, the type of the
right-hand side operand can completely be generalized by defining a second
template type parameter, which is used to specify the right-hand side's
operand type. It's up to the <code >Derived</code> class to specify the argument type of
its <code >operator+=</code> (or any other binary compound operator), whereafter the
compiler will deduct the types of the right-hand side operands for the
remaining binary operators. Here is the final implementation of the free
<code >operator+=</code> function:
        <pre>
    template &lt;class Derived, typename Rhs&gt;
    Derived &amp;operator+=(Base&lt;Derived&gt; &amp;lhs, Rhs const &amp;rhs) 
    {
        Derived tmp{ Derived{ static_cast&lt;Derived &amp;&gt;(lhs) } += rhs };
        tmp.swap(static_cast&lt;Derived &amp;&gt;(lhs));
        return static_cast&lt;Derived &amp;&gt;(lhs);
    }
</pre>
<p>
<a name="l660"></a>
<h3 >24.4.3: Insertion and extraction</h3>
    Classes also frequently define overloaded insertion and extraction
operators. Since there are no `compound insertion operators' the design shown
so far cannot be used when overloading these operators. Instead using
standardized member function signatures is advocated: <code >void
insert(std::ostream &amp;out) const</code> to insert an object into an <code >ostream</code> and
<code >void extract(std::istream &amp;in) const</code> to extract an object from an
<code >istream</code>. As these functions are only used by, respectively, the insertion
and extraction operators, they can be declared in the <code >Derived</code> class's
private interface. Instead of declaring the insertion and extraction operators
friends of the class <code >Derived</code> a single <code >friend Binops&lt;Derived&gt;</code> is
specified. This allows <code >Binops&lt;Derived&gt;</code> to define private, inline <code >iWrap</code>
and <code >eWrap</code> members, merely calling, respectively, <code >Derived's insert</code> and
<code >extract</code> members:
        <pre>
    template &lt;typename Derived&gt;
    inline void Base&lt;Derived&gt;::iWrap(std::ostream &amp;out) const
    {
        static_cast&lt;Derived const &amp;&gt;(*this).insert(out);
    }
</pre>
    <code >Base&lt;Derived&gt;</code> then declares the insertion and extraction operators as
its friends, allowing these operators to call, respectively, <code >iWrap</code> and
<code >eWrap</code>. Note that the software engineer designing the class <code >Derived</code>
only has to provide a <code >friend Base&lt;Derived&gt;</code> declaration. Here is the
implementation of the overloaded insertion operator:
        <pre>
    template &lt;typename Derived&gt;
    std::ostream &amp;operator&lt;&lt;(std::ostream &amp;out, Base&lt;Derived&gt; const &amp;obj)
    {
        obj.iWrap(out);
        return out;
    }
</pre>
<p>
This completes the coverage of the essentials of a class template <code >Binops</code>
potentially offering binary operators and insertion/extraction operators for
any class derived from <code >Binops</code>. Finally, as noted at the beginning of this
section, a complete implementation of a class offering addition and insertion
operators is provided in the file
<code >annotations/yo/concrete/examples/binopclasses.cc</code> in the <strong >C++</strong> Annotations'
source archive.

<h2 >24.5: Range-based for-loops and pointer-ranges</h2>
The standard <a name="an3400"></a>range-based for-loop requires for its range-specificiation an
array, an initializer list, or an iterator range as offered by, e.g.,
containers (through their <code >begin</code> and <code >end</code> members).
<p>
Ranges defined by a  pointer pair or by a subrange defined by iterator
expressions cannot currently be used in combination with range-based
for-loops.
<p>
The <a name="an3401"></a><code >Ranger</code> class template developed in this section defines ranges that
can be used with range-based for-loops.  <code >Ranger</code> extends the applicability
of range-based for-loops by turning pointer pairs,, an initial pointer or
iterator and a pointer count, or a pair of iterators into a range that can be
used by range-based for-loops. The <code >Ranger</code> class template can also be used
to process a pair of reverse iterators, normally not supported by range-based
for-loops.
<p>
The <code >Ranger</code> class template requires but one template type parameter:
<code >Iterator</code>, representing an iterator or pointer type reaching the data when
dereferenced. In practical applications users don't have to specify
<code >Ranger</code>'s template type. The function template <code >ranger</code> deduces the
required <code >Iterator</code> type and returns the appropriate <code >Ranger</code> object.
<p>
The <code >ranger</code> function template can be used in various ways:
    <ul>
    <li><code >Ranger&lt;Iterator&gt; ranger(Iterator const &amp;begin, Iterator const &amp;end)</code>
        this function template returns a <code >Ranger</code> object for the (sub)range
        defined by two (reverse) iterators. Its definition is:
        <pre>
template &lt;typename Iter&gt;
Ranger&lt;Iter&gt; ranger(Iter &amp;&amp;begin, Iter &amp;&amp;end)
{
    return Ranger&lt;Iter&gt;(begin, end);
}
</pre>
    <li><code >Ranger&lt;Iterator&gt; ranger(Iterator const &amp;begin, size_t count)</code>
        this function template returns a <code >Ranger</code> object for the (sub)range
        defined by the (reverse) iterator range <code >begin</code> and <code >begin +
        count</code>.
        Its definition is:
    <pre>
template &lt;typename Data&gt;
Ranger&lt;Data *&gt; ranger(Data *begin, Data *end)
{
    return Ranger&lt;Data *&gt;(begin, end);
}
</pre>
    <li><code >Ranger&lt;Data&gt; ranger(Data *begin, Data *end)</code>
        this function template returns a <code >Ranger</code> object for the (sub)range
        defined by the two pointers <code >begin</code> and <code >end</code>.
        Its definition is:
    <pre>
template &lt;typename Iter&gt;
Ranger&lt;Iter&gt; ranger(Iter &amp;&amp;begin, size_t count)
{
    return Ranger&lt;Iter&gt;(begin, begin + count);
}
</pre>
    <li><code >Ranger&lt;Data&gt; ranger(Data *begin, size_t count)</code>
        this function template returns a <code >Ranger</code> object for the (sub)range
        defined by the two pointers <code >begin</code> and <code >begin + count</code>.
        Its definition is:
    <pre>
template &lt;typename Data&gt;
Ranger&lt;Data *&gt; ranger(Data *begin, size_t count)
{
    return Ranger&lt;Data *&gt;(begin, begin + count);
}
</pre>
    </ul>
<p>
The <code >Ranger</code> class template itself offers a constructor expecting two
<code >Iterator const &amp;</code> parameters, where <code >Iterator</code> is <code >Ranger</code>'s template
type parameter. Although named 'Iterator' it can also be a pointer to some
data type (e.g., <code >std::string *</code>).
<p>
The class only needs two members, <code >begin</code> and <code >end</code>, since these are the
only members called by range-based for-loops. These members can be <code >const</code>
members, returning <code >Iterator const</code> references. This also is the required
return type if <code >Iterator</code> itself was a pointer type (like <code >int *</code>). Since
a `<code >Iterator const &amp;</code>' does not imply that the dereferenced <code >Iterator</code> is
immutable, the data to which the iterator returned by <code >begin()</code> can actually
be modified, if <code >Iterator</code> unless <code >Iterator</code> is a <code >Type const *</code> or a
<code >const_iterator</code> type.
<p>
If reverse iterators are passed to <code >Ranger</code>'s constructor (the reversed
begin iterator should be passed as <code >Ranger</code> constructor's first argument,
the reversed end iterator as its second argument), then <code >Ranger</code>'s <code >begin</code>
and <code >end</code> members return <em >reverse iterators</em>. Since the intended use of
<code >Ranger</code> objects is to define a range for range-base for-loops, members like
<code >rbegin</code> and <code >rend</code> were omitted from <code >Ranger</code>'s interface.
<p>
Here is <code >Ranger</code>'s implementation (using in-class implementations for
brevity):
        <pre>
    template &lt;typename Iter&gt;
    class Ranger
    {
        Iter d_begin;
        Iter d_end;

        public:
            Ranger(Iter const &amp;begin, Iter const &amp;end)
            :
                d_begin(begin),
                d_end(end)
            {}

            Iter const &amp;begin() const
            {
                return d_begin;
            }

            Iter const &amp;end() const
            {
                return d_end;
            }
    };
</pre>
    Using <code >ranger</code> is easy. Here is an example of a program displaying a
program's command-line arguments using a range-based for-loop:
        <pre>
    // insert all required declarations here

    int main(int argc, char **argv)
    {
        for (auto ptr: ranger(argv, argc))
            cout &lt;&lt; ptr &lt;&lt; '\n';
    }

<h2 >24.6: Distinguishing lvalues from rvalues with operator[]()</h2>
    A problem with <a name="an3402"></a><code >operator[]</code> is that it can't distinguish between its
    <a name="an3403"></a><a name="an3404"></a>
 use as an <em >lvalue</em> and as an <em >rvalue</em>. It is a familiar misconception to
think that
        <pre>
    Type const &amp;operator[](size_t index) const
</pre>
 is used as <em >rvalue</em> (as the object isn't modified), and
    that
        <pre>
    Type &amp;operator[](size_t index)
</pre>
 is used as <em >lvalue</em> (as the returned value can be modified).
<p>
The compiler, however, distinguishes between the two operators only by the
<code >const</code>-status of the object for which <code >operator[]</code> is called. With
<code >const</code> objects the former operator is called, with non-<code >const</code> objects
the latter is always used. It is always used, irrespective of it being used as
lvalue or rvalue.
<p>
Being able to distinguish between lvalues and rvalues can be very
useful. Consider the situation where a class supporting <code >operator[]</code> stores
data of a type that is very hard to copy. With data like that reference
counting (e.g., using <code >shared_ptr</code>s) is probably used to prevent needless
copying.
<p>
As long as <code >operator[]</code> is used as rvalue there's no need to copy the data,
but the information <em >must</em> be copied if it is used as lvalue.
<p>
The <a name="an3405"></a><em >Proxy Design Pattern</em> (cf. <a name="an3406"></a><em >Gamma et al.</em> (1995)) can
be used to distinguish between lvalues and rvalues. With the Proxy Design
Pattern an object of another class (the Proxy class) is used to act as a
<em >stand in</em> for the `real thing'. The proxy class offers functionality that
cannot be offered by the data themselves, like distinguishing between its use
as lvalue or rvalue. A proxy class can be used in many situations where access
to the real data cannot or should not be directly provided. In this regard
<em >iterator</em> types are examples of proxy classes as they create a layer
between the real data and the software using the data. Proxy classes could
also dereference pointers in a class storing its data by pointers.
<p>
In this section we concentrate on the distinction between using <code >operator[]</code>
as lvalue and rvalue. Let's assume we have a class <code >Lines</code> storing lines
from a file. Its constructor expects the name of a stream from which the
lines are read and it offers a non-const <code >operator[]</code> that can be used as
lvalue or rvalue (the <code >const</code> version of <code >operator[]</code> is omitted as it
causes no confusion because it is always used as rvalue):
        <pre>
    class Lines
    {
        std::vector&lt;std::string&gt; d_line;

        public:
            Lines(std::istream &amp;in);
            std::string &amp;operator[](size_t idx);
    };
</pre>
<p>
To distinguish between lvalues and rvalues we must find distinguishing
characteristics of lvalues and rvalues that we can exploit. Such
distinguishing characteristics are <code >operator=</code> (which is always used as
lvalue) and the conversion operator (which is always used as rvalue). Rather
than having <code >operator[]</code> return a <code >string &amp;</code> we can let it return a
<code >Proxy</code> object that is able to distinguish between its use as lvalue
and rvalue.
<p>
The class <code >Proxy</code> thus needs <code >operator=(string const &amp;other)</code> (acting as
lvalue) and <code >operator std::string const &amp;() const</code> (acting as rvalue). Do we
need more operators? The <code >std::string</code> class also offers <code >operator+=</code>, so
we should probably implement that operator as well. Plain characters can also
be assigned to <code >string</code> objects (even using their numeric values). As
<code >string</code> objects cannot be <em >constructed</em> from plain characters
<em >promotion</em> cannot be used with <code >operator=(string const &amp;other)</code> if the
right-hand side argument is a character. Implementing <code >operator=(char
value)</code> could therefore also be considered. These additional operators are
left out of the current implementation but `real life' proxy classes should
consider implementing these additional operators as well. Another subtlety is
  <a name="an3407"></a>
that <code >Proxy</code>'s <code >operator std::string const &amp;() const</code> is not used
when using <code >ostream</code>'s insertion operator or <code >istream</code>'s extraction
operator as these operators are implemented as templates not recognizing our
<code >Proxy</code> class type. So when stream insertion and extraction is required (it
probably is) then <code >Proxy</code> must be given its own overloaded insertion and
extraction operator. Here is an implementation of the overloaded insertion
operator inserting the object for which <code >Proxy</code> is a stand-in:
        <pre>
inline std::ostream &amp;operator&lt;&lt;(std::ostream &amp;out, Lines::Proxy const &amp;proxy)
{
    return out &lt;&lt; static_cast&lt;std::string const &amp;&gt;(proxy);
}
</pre>
<p>
There's no need for any code (except <code >Lines</code>) to create or copy <code >Proxy</code>
objects. <code >Proxy</code>'s constructor should therefore be made private, and
<code >Proxy</code> can declare <code >Lines</code> to be its friend. In fact, <code >Proxy</code> is
intimately related to <code >Lines</code> and can be defined as a nested class. In the
revised <code >Lines</code> class <code >operator[]</code> no longer returns a <code >string</code> but
instead a <code >Proxy</code> is returned. Here is the revised <code >Lines</code> class,
including its nested <code >Proxy</code> class:
        <pre>
    class Lines
    {
        std::vector&lt;std::string&gt; d_line;

        public:
            class Proxy;
            Proxy operator[](size_t idx);
            class Proxy
            {
                friend Proxy Lines::operator[](size_t idx);
                std::string &amp;d_str;
                Proxy(std::string &amp;str);
                public:
                    std::string &amp;operator=(std::string const &amp;rhs);
                    operator std::string const &amp;() const;
            };
            Lines(std::istream &amp;in);
    };
</pre>
<p>
<code >Proxy</code>'s members are very lightweight and can usually be implemented
inline:
        <pre>
    inline Lines::Proxy::Proxy(std::string &amp;str)
    :
        d_str(str)
    {}
    inline std::string &amp;Lines::Proxy::operator=(std::string const &amp;rhs)
    {
        return d_str = rhs;
    }
    inline Lines::Proxy::operator std::string const &amp;() const
    {
        return d_str;
    }
</pre>
<p>
The member <code >Lines::operator[]</code> can also be implemented inline: it merely
returns a <code >Proxy</code> object initialized with the <code >string</code> associated with
index <code >idx</code>.
<p>
Now that the class <code >Proxy</code> has been developed it can be used in a
program. Here is an example using the <code >Proxy</code> object as lvalue or rvalue. On
the surface <code >Lines</code> objects won't behave differently from <code >Lines</code> objects
using the original implementation, but by adding an identifying <code >cout</code>
statement to <code >Proxy</code>'s members it can be shown that <code >operator[]</code> behaves
differently when used as lvalue or as rvalue:
        <pre>
    int main()
    {
        ifstream in("lines.cc");
        Lines lines(in);

        string s = lines[0];        // rvalue use
        lines[0] = s;               // lvalue use
        cout &lt;&lt; lines[0] &lt;&lt; '\n';   // rvalue use
        lines[0] = "hello world";   // lvalue use
        cout &lt;&lt; lines[0] &lt;&lt; '\n';   // rvalue use
    }
</pre>

<h2 >24.7: Implementing a `reverse_iterator'</h2>
In section <a href="cplusplus22.html#RANDOMIT">22.14.1</a> the construction of iterators and
reverse iteraters was discussed. In that section the iterator was constructed
as an inner class in a class derived from a vector of pointers to strings.
<p>
An object of this nested iterator class handles the dereferencing of the
pointers stored in the vector. This allowed us to sort the <em >strings</em>
pointed to by the vector's elements rather than the <em >pointers</em>.
<p>
A drawback of this is that the class implementing the iterator is closely
tied to the derived class as the iterator class was implemented as a nested
class. What if we would like to provide any class derived from a container
class storing pointers with an iterator handling pointer-dereferencing?
<p>
In this section a variant of the earlier (nested class) approach is
discussed. Here the iterator class is defined as a class template,
    <a name="an3408"></a>
    not only parameterizing the data type to which the container's elements
point but also the container's iterator type itself. Once again, we
concentrate on developing a <a name="an3409"></a><em >RandomIterator</em> as it is the most complex
iterator type.
<p>
Our class is named <code >RandomPtrIterator</code>, indicating that it is a random
iterator operating on pointer values. The class template defines three
template type parameters:
    <ul>
    <li> The first parameter specifies the derived class type
(<code >Class</code>). Like before, <code >RandomPtrIterator</code>'s
constructor is private. Therefore <code >friend</code> declarations are needed to
allow client classes to construct <code >RandomPtrIterators</code>.  However, a
<code >friend class Class</code> cannot be used as template parameter types cannot be
    <a name="an3410"></a>
used in <code >friend class ...</code> declarations. But this is a minor problem as not
every member of the client class needs to construct iterators. In fact, only
<code >Class</code>'s <code >begin</code> and <code >end</code> members must construct
iterators. Using the template's first parameter, friend declarations can be
specified for the client's <code >begin</code> and <code >end</code> members.
    <li> The second template parameter parameterizes the container's iterator
type (<code >BaseIterator</code>);
    <li> The third template parameter indicates the data type to which the
pointers point (<code >Type</code>).
    </ul>
    <code >RandomPtrIterator</code> has one private data member, a
<code >BaseIterator</code>. Here is the class interface and the constructor's
implementation:
        <pre>
    #include &lt;iterator&gt;

    template &lt;typename Class, typename BaseIterator, typename Type&gt;
    class RandomPtrIterator:
          public std::iterator&lt;std::random_access_iterator_tag, Type&gt;
    {
        friend RandomPtrIterator&lt;Class, BaseIterator, Type&gt; Class::begin();
        friend RandomPtrIterator&lt;Class, BaseIterator, Type&gt; Class::end();

        BaseIterator d_current;

        RandomPtrIterator(BaseIterator const &amp;current);

        public:
            bool operator!=(RandomPtrIterator const &amp;other) const;
            int operator-(RandomPtrIterator const &amp;rhs) const;
            RandomPtrIterator operator+(int step) const;
            Type &amp;operator*() const;
            bool operator&lt;(RandomPtrIterator const &amp;other) const;
            RandomPtrIterator &amp;operator--();
            RandomPtrIterator operator--(int);
            RandomPtrIterator &amp;operator++();
            RandomPtrIterator operator++(int);
            bool operator==(RandomPtrIterator const &amp;other) const;
            RandomPtrIterator operator-(int step) const;
            RandomPtrIterator &amp;operator-=(int step);
            RandomPtrIterator &amp;operator+=(int step);
            Type *operator-&gt;() const;
    };

    template &lt;typename Class, typename BaseIterator, typename Type&gt;
    RandomPtrIterator&lt;Class, BaseIterator, Type&gt;::RandomPtrIterator(
                                    BaseIterator const &amp;current)
    :
        d_current(current)
    {}
</pre>
<p>
Looking at its <code >friend</code> declarations, we see that the members <code >begin</code>
and <code >end</code> of a class <code >Class</code>, returning a <code >RandomPtrIterator</code> object for
the types <code >Class, BaseIterator</code> and <code >Type</code> are granted access to
<code >RandomPtrIterator</code>'s private constructor.  That is exactly what we
want. The <code >Class</code>'s <code >begin</code> and <code >end</code> members are declared as <em >bound
friends</em>.
<p>
All <code >RandomPtrIterator</code>'s remaining members are public. Since
<code >RandomPtrIterator</code> is just a generalization of the nested class
<code >iterator</code> developed in section <a href="cplusplus22.html#RANDOMIT">22.14.1</a>, re-implementing the required
member functions is easy and only requires us to change <code >iterator</code> into
<code >RandomPtrIterator</code> and to change <code >std::string</code> into <code >Type</code>. For
example, <code >operator&lt;</code>, defined in the class <code >iterator</code> as
        <pre>
inline bool StringPtr::iterator::operator&lt;(iterator const &amp;other) const
{
    return d_current &lt; other.d_current;
}
</pre>
<p>
is now implemented as:
        <pre>
    template &lt;typename Class, typename BaseIterator, typename Type&gt;
    bool RandomPtrIterator&lt;Class, BaseIterator, Type&gt;::operator&lt;(
                                    RandomPtrIterator const &amp;other) const
    {
        return **d_current &lt; **other.d_current;
    }
</pre>
<p>
Some additional examples: <code >operator*</code>, defined in the class
<code >iterator</code> as
        <pre>
inline std::string &amp;StringPtr::iterator::operator*() const
{
    return **d_current;
}
</pre>
<p>
is now implemented as:
        <pre>
    template &lt;typename Class, typename BaseIterator, typename Type&gt;
    Type &amp;RandomPtrIterator&lt;Class, BaseIterator, Type&gt;::operator*() const
    {
        return **d_current;
    }
</pre>
<p>
The pre- and postfix increment operators are now implemented as:
        <pre>
    template &lt;typename Class, typename BaseIterator, typename Type&gt;
    RandomPtrIterator&lt;Class, BaseIterator, Type&gt;
    &amp;RandomPtrIterator&lt;Class, BaseIterator, Type&gt;::operator++()
    {
        ++d_current;
        return *this;
    }
    template &lt;typename Class, typename BaseIterator, typename Type&gt;
    RandomPtrIterator&lt;Class, BaseIterator, Type&gt;
    RandomPtrIterator&lt;Class, BaseIterator, Type&gt;::operator++(int)
    {
        return RandomPtrIterator(d_current++);
    }
</pre>
<p>
Remaining members can be implemented accordingly, their actual
implementations are left as exercises to the reader (or can be obtained from
the <code >cplusplus.yo.zip</code> archive, of course).
<p>
Re-implementing the class <code >StringPtr</code> developed in section <a href="cplusplus22.html#RANDOMIT">22.14.1</a>
is not difficult either. Apart from including the header file defining the
class template <code >RandomPtrIterator</code>, it only requires a single modification.
Its <code >iterator</code> typedef must now be associated with a
<code >RandomPtrIterator</code>. Here is the full class interface and the class's inline
member definitions:
        <pre>
    #ifndef INCLUDED_STRINGPTR_H_
    #define INCLUDED_STRINGPTR_H_

    #include &lt;vector&gt;
    #include &lt;string&gt;
    #include "iterator.h"

    class StringPtr: public std::vector&lt;std::string *&gt;
    {
        public:
            typedef RandomPtrIterator
                    &lt;
                        StringPtr,
                        std::vector&lt;std::string *&gt;::iterator,
                        std::string
                    &gt;
                        iterator;

            typedef std::reverse_iterator&lt;iterator&gt; reverse_iterator;

            iterator begin();
            iterator end();
            reverse_iterator rbegin();
            reverse_iterator rend();
    };

    inline StringPtr::iterator StringPtr::begin()
    {
        return iterator(this-&gt;std::vector&lt;std::string *&gt;::begin() );
    }
    inline StringPtr::iterator StringPtr::end()
    {
        return iterator(this-&gt;std::vector&lt;std::string *&gt;::end());
    }
    inline StringPtr::reverse_iterator StringPtr::rbegin()
    {
        return reverse_iterator(end());
    }
    inline StringPtr::reverse_iterator StringPtr::rend()
    {
        return reverse_iterator(begin());
    }
    #endif
</pre>
<p>
Including <code >StringPtr</code>'s modified header file into the program given in
section <a href="cplusplus22.html#REVERSEIT">22.14.2</a> results in a program behaving identically to its
earlier version. In this case <code >StringPtr::begin</code> and <code >StringPtr::end</code>
return iterator objects constructed from a template definition.

<h2 >24.8: Using `bisonc++' and `flexc++'</h2>
    The example discussed below digs into the peculiarities of using
<a name="an3411"></a>parser- and <a name="an3412"></a>scanner generators generating <strong >C++</strong> sources. Once the
input for a program exceeds a certain level of complexity, it becomes
attractive to use scanner- and parser-generators generating the code which
does the actual input recognition.
<p>
The examples in this and subsequent sections assume that the reader knows how
to use the
    <a name="an3413"></a>scanner generator <a name="an3414"></a><code >flex</code> and the <a name="an3415"></a>parser generator <a name="an3416"></a><code >bison</code>. Both
<code >bison</code> and <code >flex</code> are well documented elsewhere. The original
predecessors of <code >bison</code> and <code >flex</code>, called <a name="an3417"></a><code >yacc</code> and <a name="an3418"></a><code >lex</code> are
described in several books, e.g. in
    <a name="an3419"></a>
 O'Reilly's book <a href="http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/lex">`lex &amp; yacc'</a>.
<p>
Scanner- and parser generators are also available as free software. Both
<code >bison</code> and <code >flex</code> are usually part of software distributions or they can
be obtained from
    <a name="an3420"></a>
    <a target=_top href="ftp://prep.ai.mit.edu/pub/non-gnu">ftp://prep.ai.mit.edu/pub/non-gnu</a>. <code >Flex</code> creates a <code >C++</code> class
when <a name="an3421"></a><code >%option c++</code> is specified.
<p>
For parser generators the program <a name="an3422"></a><code >bison</code> is available. In the early 90's
<em >Alain Coetmeur</em> (<a href="mailto:coetmeur@icdc.fr">coetmeur@icdc.fr</a>) created a
<strong >C++</strong> variant (<a name="an3423"></a><code >bison++</code>) creating a parser class. Although the
<code >bison++</code> program produces code that can be used in <strong >C++</strong> programs it also
shows many characteristics that are more suggestive of a <strong >C</strong> context than a
<strong >C++</strong> context. In January 2005 I rewrote parts of Alain's <code >bison++</code>
program, resulting in the original version of the program
        <a name="an3424"></a>
    <strong >bisonc++</strong>. Then, in May 2005 a complete rewrite of the <code >bisonc++</code>
parser generator was completed (version number 0.98). Current versions of
<code >bisonc++</code> can be downloaded from
    <a target=_top href="https://fbb-git.github.io/bisoncpp/">https://fbb-git.github.io/bisoncpp/</a>. Binary versions for various
architectures are available as, e.g., <a href="http://www.debian.org">Debian</a>
package (including <code >bisonc++</code>'s documentation).
<p>
<code >Bisonc++</code> creates a cleaner parser class than <code >bison++</code>. In particular,
it derives the parser class from a base-class, containing the parser's token-
and type-definitions as well as all member functions which should not be
(re)defined by the programmer. As a result of this approach, the generated
parser class is very small, declaring only members that are actually defined
by the programmer (as well as some other members, generated by <code >bisonc++</code>
itself, implementing the parser's <a name="an3425"></a><code >parse()</code> member). One member that is
<em >not</em> implemented by default is <code >lex</code>, producing the next lexical
token. When the directive <code >%scanner</code> (see section <a href="cplusplus24.html#BISONDEF">24.8.2.1</a>) is used,
<code >bisonc++</code> produces a standard implementation for this member; otherwise it
must be implemented by the programmer.
<p>
In early 2012 the program
    <a name="an3426"></a>
    <strong >flexc++</strong> <a target=_top href="http://flexcpp.org/">http://flexcpp.org/</a> reached its initial release. Like
<code >bisonc++</code> it is part of the <a href="http://www.debian.org">Debian linux
distribution</a>.
<p>
Jean-Paul van Oosten (<a href="mailto:j.p.van.oosten@rug.nl"><em >j.p.van.oosten@rug.nl</em></a>) and Richard Berendsen
(<a href="mailto:richardberendsen@xs4all.nl"><em >richardberendsen@xs4all.nl</em></a>) started the <code >flexc++</code> project in 2008
and the final program was completed by Jean-Paul and me between 2010 and 2012.
<p>
These sections of the <strong >C++</strong> Annotations focus on <code >bisonc++</code> as our
 <a name="an3427"></a><em >parser generator</em> and <code >flexc++</code> as our lexical scanner
generator. Previous releases of the <strong >C++</strong> Annotations were using <code >flex</code> as the
scanner generator.
<p>
Using <code >flex++</code> and <code >bisonc++</code> <code >class</code>-based scanners and parsers are
generated. The advantage of this approach is that the interface to the scanner
and the parser tends to become cleaner than without using <code >class</code>
interfaces. Furthermore, classes allow us to get rid of most if not all global
variables, making it easy to use multiple parsers in one program.
<p>
Below two example programs are developed. The first example only uses
<code >flexc++</code>. The generated scanner monitors the production of a file from
several parts. That example focuses on the lexical scanner and on switching
files while churning through the information. The second example uses both
<code >flexc++</code> and <code >bisonc++</code> to generate a scanner and a parser transforming
standard arithmetic expressions to their postfix notations, commonly used in
code generated by compilers and in <code >HP</code>-calculators.  In the second example
the emphasis is mainly on <code >bisonc++</code> and on composing a scanner object
inside a generated parser.

<h3 >24.8.1: Using `flexc++' to create a scanner</h3>
    The lexical scanner developed in this section is used to monitor the
production of a file from several subfiles. The setup is as follows: the
input-language defines <code >#include</code> directives, followed by a text
string specifying the file (path) which should be included at the location of
the <code >#include</code>.
<p>
In order to avoid complexities irrelevant to the current example, the format
of the <code >#include</code> statement is restricted to the form <code >#include
&lt;filepath&gt;</code>.  The file specified between the pointed brackets should be
available at the location indicated by <code >filepath</code>. If the file is not
available, the program terminates after issuing an error message.
<p>
The program is started with one or two filename arguments. If the program is
started with just one filename argument, the output is written to the
standard output stream <code >cout</code>. Otherwise, the output is written to
the stream whose name is given as the program's second argument.
<p>
The program defines a maximum <a name="an3428"></a>nesting depth. Once this maximum is exceeded,
the program terminates after issuing an error message. In that case, the
filename stack indicating where which file was included is printed.
<p>
An additional feature of the program is that (standard <strong >C++</strong>) comment-lines
are ignored. Include-directives in comment-lines are also ignored.
<p>
The program is created in five major steps:
    <ul>
    <li> First, the file <code >lexer</code> is constructed, containing the
input-language specifications.
    <li> From the specifications in <code >lexer</code> the requirements for the
<code >class Scanner</code> evolve. The <code >Scanner</code> class derives from the base class
<a name="an3429"></a><code >ScannerBase</code> generated by <a name="an3430"></a><code >flexc++</code>.
    <li> Next, <code >main</code> is constructed. A <code >Scanner</code> object is created
inspecting the command-line arguments. If successful, the scanner's member
<code >lex</code> is called to produce the program's output.
    <li> Now that  the global setup of the program has been specified,
the member functions of the various classes are implemented.
    <li> Finally, the program is compiled and linked.
    </ul>
<p>
<a name="l666"></a>
<h4>24.8.1.1: The derived class `Scanner'</h4>
            The function matching the <a name="an3431"></a>regular expression rules (<code >lex</code>) is a
member of the class <a name="an3432"></a><code >Scanner</code>. Since <code >Scanner</code> is derived from
<code >ScannerBase</code>, it has access to all of <code >ScannerBase</code>'s protected members
that execute the lexical scanner's regular expression matching algorithm.
<p>
Looking at the regular expressions themselves, notice that we need rules
to recognize comment, <a name="an3433"></a><code >#include</code> directives, and all remaining characters.
This all is fairly standard practice. When an <code >#include</code> directive is
sensed, the directive is parsed by the scanner. This too is common
practice. Our lexical scanner performs the following tasks:
    <ul>
    <li> As usual, <a name="an3434"></a>preprocessor directives are not
analyzed by a parser, but by the lexical scanner;
    <li> The scanner uses a <a name="an3435"></a>mini scanner to extract the filename from the
directive, throwing a exception if this fails;
    <li> If the filename could be extracted, processing switches to the next
stream, controlling for a maximum nesting depth.
    <li> Once the end of the current file has been reached processing
automatically returns to the previous file, restoring the previous file name
an line number. The scanner returns 0 if all files have been processed.
    </ul>
<p>
<a name="l667"></a>
<h4>24.8.1.2: The lexical scanner specification file</h4>
            The <a name="an3436"></a>lexical scanner specification file is organized comparably to the
one used for <code >flex</code> in <strong >C</strong> contexts. However, in <strong >C++</strong> contexts,
<code >flexc++</code> creates a class <code >Scanner</code>, rather than just a scanner function.
<p>
Flexc++'s specification file consists of two sections:
    <ul>
    <li> The specification file's first section is <code >flexc++</code>'s
        <a name="an3437"></a><em >symbol area</em>, used to define symbols, like a <a name="an3438"></a>mini scanner, or
<a name="an3439"></a><em >options</em>. The following options are suggested:
        <ul>
        <li> <a name="an3440"></a><code >%debug</code>: includes <em >debugging</em>
            <a name="an3441"></a>
        code into the code generated by <code >flexc++</code>. Calling the member
function
            <a name="an3442"></a>
            <a name="an3443"></a>
    <code >setDebug(true)</code> activates this debugging code at run-time. When
activated, information about the matching process is written to the
standard output stream. The execution of debug code is suppressed after
calling the member function <code >setDebug(false)</code>.
        <li> <a name="an3444"></a><code >%filenames</code>: defines the base-name of the class header files
generated by <code >flexc++</code>. By default the class name (itself using the default
<code >Scanner</code>) is used.
        </ul>
    Here is the specification files' symbol area:
            <pre>
%filenames scanner
%debug
%max-depth 3

%x      comment
%x      include
</pre>
<p>
<li> The specification file's second section is a <em >rules section</em> in
which the regular expressions and their associated actions are defined.
    In the example developed here,  the lexer should
copy information from the standard input stream (<code >std::cin</code>) to the
standard output stream (<code >std::cout</code>). For this  the predefined macro
<a name="an3445"></a><code >ECHO</code> can be used.  Here are the rules:
            <pre>
%%
    // The comment-rules: comment is ignored.
//.*                    // ignore eoln comment
"/*"                    begin(StartCondition__::comment);
&lt;comment&gt;{
    .|\n                // ignore all characters in std C comment
    "*/"                begin(StartCondition__::INITIAL);
}

    // File switching: #include &lt;filepath&gt;
#include[ \t]+"&lt;"      begin(StartCondition__::include);
&lt;include&gt;{
    [^ \t&gt;]+            d_nextSource = matched();
    "&gt;"[ \t]*\n         switchSource();
    .|\n                throw runtime_error("Invalid include statement");
}

    // The default rule: echo anything else to std::cout
.|\n                    echo();
</pre>
<p>
</ul>
<p>
<a name="l668"></a>
<h4>24.8.1.3: Implementing `Scanner'</h4>
            The <code >class Scanner</code> is generated once by <a name="an3446"></a><strong >flexc++</strong>. This class has
access to several members defined by its base class <code >ScannerBase</code>. Some of
these members have public access rights and can be used by code external to
the class <code >Scanner</code>. These members are extensively documented in the
<strong >flexc++</strong>(1) man-page, and the reader is referred to this man-page for
further information.
<p>
Our scanner performs the following tasks:
    <ul>
    <li> it matches regular expressions, ignoring comment, and writing the
matched text to the standard output stream;
    <li> it switches to other files, and returns to the previous file once a
file has completely been processed, ending the lexical scan once the end of
the first input file has been reached.
    </ul>
<p>
The <code >#include</code> statements in the input allow the scanner to distill the
name of the file where the scanning process must continue. This file name is
stored in a local variable <code >d_nextSource</code> and a member <code >stackSource</code>
handles the switch to the next source. Nothing else is required. Pushing and
popping input files is handled by the scanner's members <code >pushStream</code> and
<code >popStream</code>, provided by <code >flexc++</code>. <code >Scanner</code>'s interface, therefore,
only needs one additional function declaration: <code >switchSource</code>.
<p>
Switching streams is handled as follows: once the scanner has extracted a
filename from an <code >#include</code> directive, a switch to another file is realized
by <code >switchSource</code>.  This member calls <code >pushStream</code>, defined by
<code >flexc++</code>, to stack the current input stream and to switch to the stream
whose name is stored in <code >d_nextSource</code>. This also ends the <code >include</code>
mini-scanner, so to return the scanner to its default scanning mode
<code >begin(StartCondition__::INITIAL)</code> is called. Here is its source:
        <pre>
#include "scanner.ih"

void Scanner::switchSource()
{
    pushStream(d_nextSource);
    begin(StartCondition__::INITIAL);
}
</pre>
<p>
The member <code >pushStream</code>, defined by <code >flexc++</code>, handles all necessary
checks, throwing an exception if the file could not be opened or if too many
files are stacked.
<p>
The member performing the lexical scan is defined by <code >flexc++</code> in
<code >Scanner::lex</code>, and this member can be called by code to process the tokens
returned by the scanner.
<p>
<a name="l669"></a>
<h4>24.8.1.4: Using a `Scanner' object</h4>
            The program using our <code >Scanner</code> is very simple. It expects a filename
indicating where to start the scanning process.
<p>
The program first checks the number of arguments. If at least one argument was
given, then that argument is passed to <code >Scanner</code>'s constructor, together
with a second argument <code >"-"</code>, indicating that the output should go to the
standard output stream.
<p>
If the program receives more than one argument debug output, extensively
documenting the lexical scanner's actions, is written to the standard output
stream as well.
<p>
Next the <code >Scanner</code>'s <code >lex</code> member is called. If anything fails, a
<code >std::exception</code> is thrown, which is caught by <code >main</code>'s try-block's catch
clause. Here is the program's source:
        <pre>
#include "lexer.ih"

int main(int argc, char **argv)
try
{
    if (argc == 1)
    {
        cerr &lt;&lt; "Filename argument required\n";
        return 1;
    }

    Scanner scanner(argv[1], "-");

    scanner.setDebug(argc &gt; 2);

    return scanner.lex();
}
catch (exception const &amp;exc)
{
    cerr &lt;&lt; exc.what() &lt;&lt; '\n';
    return 1;
}
</pre>

<h4>24.8.1.5: Building the program</h4>
            The final program is constructed in two steps. These steps are given for a
<a name="an3447"></a>Unix system, on which <a name="an3448"></a><code >flexc++</code> and the <a name="an3449"></a>Gnu <strong >C++</strong> compiler <a name="an3450"></a><code >g++</code>
have been installed:
    <ul>
    <li> First, the lexical scanner's source is created using <code >flexc++</code>. For
this the following command can be given:
        <pre>
    flexc++ lexer
</pre>
    <li> Next, all sources are compiled and linked:
        <pre>
    g++ --std=c++14 -Wall *.cc
</pre>
     </ul>
    <code >Flexc++</code> can be downloaded from
    <a name="an3451"></a>
    <a target=_top href="https://fbb-git.github.io/flexcpp/">https://fbb-git.github.io/flexcpp/</a>, 
        and requires the <a name="an3452"></a><code >bobcat</code> library, which can be downloaded from

<p>
<a name="BISONFLEX"></a><a name="l671"></a>
<h3 >24.8.2: Using `bisonc++' and `flexc++'</h3>
    Once an <a name="an3454"></a>input language exceeds a certain level of complexity, a <a name="an3455"></a><em >parser</em>
is often used to control the complexity of the language. In this case, a
<a name="an3456"></a><em >parser generator</em> can be used to generate the code verifying the input's
grammatical correctness.  The lexical scanner (preferably composed into the
parser) provides chunks of the input, called <a name="an3457"></a><em >tokens</em>. The parser
then processes the series of tokens generated by the lexical scanner.
<p>
Starting point when developing programs that use both parsers and scanners is
the <a name="an3458"></a>grammar. The grammar defines a <em >set of tokens</em> that can be returned
by the lexical scanner (called the <a name="an3459"></a><em >scanner</em> below).
<p>
Finally, auxiliary code is provided to `fill in the blanks': the <a name="an3460"></a>actions
performed by the parser and by the scanner are not normally specified
literally in the grammar rules or lexical regular expressions, but
should be implemented in <em >member functions</em>, called from  the parser's
rules or which are associated with the scanner's regular expressions.
<p>
In the previous section we've seen an example of a <strong >C++</strong> class generated by
<a name="an3461"></a><code >flexc++</code>. In the current section we concentrate on the parser. The parser
can be generated from a grammar specification file, processed by the program
<a name="an3462"></a><code >bisonc++</code>. The grammar specification file required by <code >bisonc++</code> is
similar to the file processed by <a name="an3463"></a><code >bison</code> (or <a name="an3464"></a><code >bison++</code>, <code >bisonc++</code>'s
predecessor, written in the early nineties by
    <a name="an3465"></a> <em >Alain Coetmeur</em>).
<p>
In this section a program is developed converting <em >infix expressions</em>,
where binary operators are written between their operands, to <em >postfix
expressions</em>, where operators are written behind their operands. Also, the
unary operator <code >-</code> is converted from its prefix notation to a postfix form.
The unary <code >+</code> operator is ignored as it requires no further actions. In
essence our little calculator is a micro compiler, transforming numeric
expressions into assembly-like instructions.
<p>
Our calculator recognizes a rather basic set of operators:
multiplication, addition, parentheses, and the unary minus. We'll
distinguish real numbers from integers, to illustrate a subtlety in
bison-like grammar specifications. That's all. The purpose of this section is,
after all, to illustrate the construction of a <strong >C++</strong> program that uses both
a parser and a lexical scanner, rather than to construct a full-fledged
calculator.
<p>
In the coming sections we'll develop the grammar specification for
<code >bisonc++</code>. Then, the regular expressions for the scanner are
specified. Following that, the final program is constructed.
<p>
<a name="l672"></a>
<h4>24.8.2.1: The `bisonc++' specification file</h4>
        The <a name="an3466"></a>grammar specification file required by <a name="an3467"></a><code >bisonc++</code> is comparable to
the specification file required by <a name="an3468"></a><code >bison</code>. Differences are related to the
class nature of the resulting parser. Our calculator distinguishes real
numbers from integers, and supports a basic set of arithmetic operators.
<p>
<code >Bisonc++</code> should be used as follows:
    <ul>
    <li> As usual, a grammar is  defined. With <code >bisonc++</code> this is no
        different, and <code >bisonc++</code> grammar definitions are for all practical
        purposes identical to <code >bison</code>'s grammar definitions.
    <li> Having specified the grammar and (usually) some declarations
        <code >bisonc++</code> can generate files defining the parser class and
        the implementation of the member function <code >parse</code>.
    <li> All class members (except those that are required for the proper
        functioning of the member <code >parse</code>) must be
        separately implemented.  Of course, they should also be
        declared in the parser class's header.  At the very least the member
        <a name="an3469"></a><code >lex</code> must be implemented. This member is called by <code >parse</code> to
        obtain the next available token.  However, <code >bisonc++</code> offers a
        facility providing a standard implementation of the function
        <code >lex</code>. The member function
            <a name="an3470"></a><code >error(char const *msg)</code>
       is given a simple default implementation that may be modified by the
        programmer. The member function <code >error</code> is called when <code >parse</code>
        detects (syntactic) errors.
    <li> The parser can now be used in a program. A very simple example would
        be:
    <pre>
int main()
{
    Parser parser;
    return parser.parse();
}
</pre>
    </ul>
<p>
The <code >bisonc++</code> <a name="an3471"></a> specification file has two
sections:
    <ul>
    <li> The <em >declaration section</em>. In this section bison's tokens, and the
        priority rules for the operators are declared. However, <code >bisonc++</code>
        also supports several new declarations.  These new declarations are
        important and are discussed below.
    <li> The <em >rules section</em>. The <a name="an3472"></a>grammatical rules define the
        grammar. This section is identical to the one required by <code >bison</code>,
        albeit that some members that were available in <code >bison</code> and
        <code >bison++</code> are obsolete in <code >bisonc++</code>, while other members can be
        used in a wider context.  For example, <strong >ACCEPT</strong> and <strong >ABORT</strong> can be
        called from any member called from the parser's action blocks to
        terminate the parsing process.
    </ul>
 Readers familiar with <code >bison</code> may note that there is no
    <a name="an3473"></a><em >header section</em> anymore. Header sections are used by bison to provide
for the necessary declarations allowing the compiler to compile the <strong >C</strong>
function generated by <code >bison</code>. In <strong >C++</strong> declarations are part of or
already used by class definitions. Therefore, a parser generator generating a
<strong >C++</strong> class and some of its member functions does not require a header
section anymore.
<p>
<a name="BISONDEF"></a>
        <h5>The declaration section</h5><br>
            The <a name="an3474"></a>declaration section contains several sets of declarations, among
which definitions of all the tokens used in the grammar and the priorities and
associativities of the mathematical operators. Moreover, several new and
important specifications can be used here as well. Those relevant to our
current example and only available in <code >bisonc++</code> are discussed here. The
reader is referred to <code >bisonc++</code>'s man-page for a full description.
    <ul>
    <li> <a name="an3475"></a><strong >%baseclass-preinclude</strong> <code >header</code><br/>
          Use <code >header</code> as the pathname to the file pre-included in the
           parser's base-class header.  This declaration is useful in
           situations where the base class header file refers to types which
           might not yet be known. E.g., with <a name="an3476"></a><code >%union</code> a <code >std::string *</code>
           field might be used. Since the class <code >std::string</code> might not yet
           be known to the compiler once it processes the base class header
           file we need a way to inform the compiler about these classes and
           types. The suggested procedure is to use a pre-include header file
           declaring the required types. By default <code >header</code> is
           surrounded by double quotes (using, e.g., <code >#include "header"</code>).
           When the argument is surrounded by angle brackets <code >#include
           &lt;header&gt;</code> is included. In the latter case, quotes might be
           required to escape interpretation by the shell (e.g., using <code >-H
           '&lt;header&gt;'</code>).
    <li> <a name="an3477"></a><strong >%filenames</strong> <code >header</code> <br/>
           Defines the generic name of all generated files, unless overridden
            by specific names. By default the generated files use the
           class-name as the generic file name.
    <li> <a name="an3478"></a><strong >%scanner</strong> <code >header</code><br/>
           Use <code >header</code> as the pathname to the file pre-included in the
            parser's class header. This file should define a class
            <code >Scanner</code>, offering a member <code >int lex()</code> producing the next
            token from the input stream to be analyzed by the parser generated
            by <code >bisonc++</code>. When this option is used the parser's member
            <code >int lex()</code> is predefined as (assuming the default parser class
            name <code >Parser</code> is used):
            <pre>
inline int Parser::lex()
{
    return d_scanner.lex();
}
</pre>
           and an object <code >Scanner d_scanner</code> is composed into the
            parser. The <code >d_scanner</code> object is constructed by its
            default constructor. If another constructor is required, the
            parser class may be provided with an appropriate (overloaded)
            parser constructor after having constructed the default parser
            class header file using <code >bisonc++</code>.  By default <code >header</code> is
            surrounded by double quotes (using, e.g., <code >#include
            "header"</code>).  When the argument is surrounded by angle brackets
            <code >#include &lt;header&gt;</code> is included.
    <li> <a name="an3479"></a><strong >%stype</strong> <code >typename</code> <br/>
           The type of the semantic value of tokens.  The specification
            <code >typename</code> should be the name of an unstructured type (e.g.,
            <code >size_t</code>). By default it is <code >int</code>. See <code >YYSTYPE</code> in
            <code >bison</code>.  It should not be used if a <code >%union</code> specification is
            used.  Within the parser class, this type may be used as
            <code >STYPE</code>.
    <li> <a name="an3480"></a><strong >%union</strong> <code >union-definition</code> <br/>
           Acts identically to the <code >bison</code> declaration.  As with <code >bison</code>
            this generates a union for the parser's semantic type.  The union
            type is named <code >STYPE</code>. If no <code >%union</code> is declared, a simple
            stack-type may be defined using the <code >%stype</code> declaration. If no
            <code >%stype</code> declaration is used, the default stacktype (<code >int</code>) is
            used.
    </ul>
    An example of a <code >%union</code> declaration is:
        <pre>
    %union
    {
        int     i;
        double  d;
    };
</pre>
    In pre-C++11 code a <a name="an3481"></a>union cannot contain objects as its fields, as
constructors cannot be called when a union is created.  This means that
    <a name="an3482"></a> a <code >string</code> cannot be a member of the
union. A <code >string *</code>, however, <em >is</em> a possible union member.  It might also
be possible to use <em >unrestricted unions</em> (cf. section <a href="cplusplus12.html#UNIONS">12.6</a>), having
class type objects as fields.
<p>
As an aside: the scanner does not have to know about such a union. It
can simply pass its scanned text to the parser through its <a name="an3483"></a><code >matched</code> member
function. For example using a statement like
        <pre>
    $$.i = A2x(d_scanner.matched());
</pre>
    matched text is converted to a value of an appropriate type.
<p>
Tokens and non-terminals can be associated with union fields. This is
strongly advised, as it prevents type mismatches, since the compiler may then
check for type correctness. At the same time, the bison specific
variables <code >$$</code>, <code >$1</code>, <code >$2</code>, etc. may be used, rather than the full field
specification (like <code >$$.i</code>).  A non-terminal or a token may be associated
with a union field using the
    <code >&lt;fieldname&gt;</code> specification. E.g.,
        <pre>
    %token &lt;i&gt; INT          // token association (deprecated, see below)
           &lt;d&gt; DOUBLE
    %type  &lt;i&gt; intExpr      // non-terminal association
</pre>
    In the example developed here, both the tokens and the non-terminals can
be associated with a union field. However, as noted before, the scanner does
not have to know about all this. In our opinion, it is cleaner to let the
scanner do just one thing: scan texts. The <em >parser</em>, knowing what the input
is all about, may then convert strings like <code >"123"</code> to an integer
value. Consequently, the association of a union field and a token is
discouraged. Below, while describing the grammar's rules, this is further
illustrated.
<p>
In the <code >%union</code> discussion the <a name="an3484"></a><code >%token</code> and <a name="an3485"></a><code >%type</code> specifications
should be noted. They are used to specify the tokens (terminal symbols) that
can be returned by the scanner, and to specify the return types of
non-terminals.  Apart from <code >%token</code> the token declarators <a name="an3486"></a><code >%left</code>,
<a name="an3487"></a><code >%right</code>, and <a name="an3488"></a><code >%nonassoc</code> can be used to specify the associativity of
operators. The tokens mentioned at these indicators are interpreted as tokens
indicating operators, associating in the indicated direction. The precedence
of operators is defined by their order: the first specification has the lowest
priority. To overrule a certain precedence in a certain context <a name="an3489"></a><code >%prec</code> can
be used. As all this is standard <code >bisonc++</code> practice, it isn't further
elaborated here. The documentation provided with <code >bisonc++</code>'s distribution
should be consulted for further reference.
<p>
Here is the specification of the calculator's declaration section:
        <pre>
%filenames parser
%scanner ../scanner/scanner.h

%union {
    int i;
    double d;
};

%token  INT DOUBLE

%type   &lt;i&gt; intExpr
%type   &lt;d&gt; doubleExpr

%left   '+'
%left   '*'
%right  UnaryMinus
</pre>
<p>
In the declaration section <code >%type</code> specifiers are used, associating the
<code >intExpr</code> rule's value (see the next section) to the <code >i</code>-field of the
semantic-value union, and associating <code >doubleExpr</code>'s value to the
<code >d</code>-field. This approach, admittedly, is rather complex, as expression rules
must be included for each of the supported union types. Alternatives are
definitely possible, and involve the use of <em >polymorphic semantic
values</em>, covered in detail in the 
    <a href="http://fbb-git.github.io/bisoncpp/manual/bisonc++.html">Bisonc++ user guide</a>.
<p>

        <h5>The grammar rules</h5><br>
            The rules and actions of the grammar are specified as usual. The grammar
for our little calculator is given below. There are quite a few rules, but
they illustrate various features offered by <code >bisonc++</code>. In particular, note
that no action block requires more than a single line of code. This keeps the
grammar simple, and therefore enhances its readability and
understandability. Even the rule defining the parser's proper termination (the
empty line in the <code >line</code> rule) uses a single member function called
<code >done</code>. The implementation of that function is simple, but it is worth while
noting that it calls <strong >Parser::ACCEPT</strong>, showing that <strong >ACCEPT</strong> can be called
indirectly from a production rule's action block. Here are the grammar's
production rules:
        <pre>
    lines:
        lines
        line
    |
        line
    ;

    line:
        intExpr
        '\n'
        {
            display($1);
        }
    |
        doubleExpr
        '\n'
        {
            display($1);
        }
    |
        '\n'
        {
            done();
        }
    |
        error
        '\n'
        {
            reset();
        }
    ;

    intExpr:
        intExpr '*' intExpr
        {
            $$ = exec('*', $1, $3);
        }
    |
        intExpr '+' intExpr
        {
            $$ = exec('+', $1, $3);
        }
    |
        '(' intExpr ')'
        {

            $$ = $2;
        }
    |
        '-' intExpr         %prec UnaryMinus
        {
            $$ = neg($2);
        }
    |
        INT
        {
            $$ = convert&lt;int&gt;();
        }
    ;

    doubleExpr:
        doubleExpr '*' doubleExpr
        {
            $$ = exec('*', $1, $3);
        }
    |
        doubleExpr '*' intExpr
        {
            $$ = exec('*', $1, d($3));
        }
    |
        intExpr '*' doubleExpr
        {
            $$ = exec('*', d($1), $3);
        }
    |
        doubleExpr '+' doubleExpr
        {
            $$ = exec('+', $1, $3);
        }
    |
        doubleExpr '+' intExpr
        {
            $$ = exec('+', $1, d($3));
        }
    |
        intExpr '+' doubleExpr
        {
            $$ = exec('+', d($1), $3);
        }
    |
        '(' doubleExpr ')'
        {
            $$ = $2;
        }
    |
        '-' doubleExpr         %prec UnaryMinus
        {

            $$ = neg($2);
        }
    |
        DOUBLE
        {
            $$ = convert&lt;double&gt;();
        }
    ;
</pre>
<p>
This grammar is used to implement a simple calculator in which integer and
real values can be negated, added, and multiplied and in which standard
priority rules can be overruled by parentheses. The grammar shows the use of
typed nonterminal symbols: <code >doubleExpr</code> is linked to real (double) values,
<code >intExpr</code> is linked to integer values. Precedence and type association is
defined in the parser's definition section.
<p>

        <h5>The Parser's header file</h5><br>
        Several class members called from the grammar are defined as member
templates. <code >Bisonc++</code> generates multiple files, among which the file
defining the parser's class. Functions called from the production rule's
action blocks are usually member functions of the parser. These member
functions must be declared and defined. Once <code >bisonc++</code> has generated the
header file defining the parser's class, that header file isn't automatically
rewritten, allowing the programmer to add new members to the parser class
whenever required. Here is `<code >parser.h</code>' as used in our little calculator:
        <pre>
#ifndef Parser_h_included
#define Parser_h_included

#include &lt;iostream&gt;
#include &lt;sstream&gt;
#include &lt;bobcat/a2x&gt;

#include "parserbase.h"
#include "../scanner/scanner.h"

#undef Parser
class Parser: public ParserBase
{
    std::ostringstream d_rpn;
    // $insert scannerobject
    Scanner d_scanner;

    public:
        int parse();

    private:
        template &lt;typename Type&gt;
        Type exec(char c, Type left, Type right);

        template &lt;typename Type&gt;
        Type neg(Type op);

        template &lt;typename Type&gt;
        Type convert();

        void display(int x);
        void display(double x);
        void done() const;
        void reset();
        void error(char const *msg);
        int lex();
        void print();

        static double d(int i);

    // support functions for parse():

        void executeAction(int d_ruleNr);
        void errorRecovery();
        int lookup(bool recovery);
        void nextToken();
        void print__();
};

inline double Parser::d(int i)
{
    return i;
}

template &lt;typename Type&gt;
Type Parser::exec(char c, Type left, Type right)
{
    d_rpn &lt;&lt; " " &lt;&lt; c &lt;&lt; " ";
    return c == '*' ? left * right : left + right;
}

template &lt;typename Type&gt;
Type Parser::neg(Type op)
{
    d_rpn &lt;&lt; " n ";
    return -op;
}

template &lt;typename Type&gt;
Type Parser::convert()
{
    Type ret = FBB::A2x(d_scanner.matched());
    d_rpn &lt;&lt; " " &lt;&lt; ret &lt;&lt; " ";
    return ret;
}

inline void Parser::error(char const *msg)
{
    std::cerr &lt;&lt; msg &lt;&lt; '\n';
}

inline int Parser::lex()
{
    return d_scanner.lex();
}

inline void Parser::print()
{}

<h4>24.8.2.2: The `flexc++' specification file</h4>
            The flex-specification file used by the calculator is simple: blanks are
ignored, single characters are returned, and numeric values are returned as
either <code >Parser::INT</code> or <code >Parser::DOUBLE</code> tokens.
<p>
The <code >flexc++</code> directive <code >%interactive</code> is provided since the
calculator is a program actively interacting with its human user.
<p>
Here is the complete <code >flexc++</code> specification file:
        <pre>
%interactive
%filenames scanner

%%

[ \t]                       // ignored

[0-9]+                      return Parser::INT;

"."[0-9]*                   |
[0-9]+("."[0-9]*)?          return Parser::DOUBLE;

.|\n                        return matched()[0];
</pre>
<p>
<a name="l674"></a>
<h4>24.8.2.3: Building the program</h4>
        The calculator is built using <code >bisonc++</code> and <code >flexc++</code>.  Here is the
implentation of the calculator's <code >main</code> function:
        <pre>
#include "parser/parser.h"

using namespace std;

int main()
{
    Parser parser;

    cout &lt;&lt; "Enter (nested) expressions containing ints, doubles, *, + and "
            "unary -\n"
            "operators. Enter an empty line to stop.\n";

    return parser.parse();
}
</pre>
<p>
The parser's files <code >parse.cc</code> and <code >parserbase.h</code> are generated by the
command:
        <pre>
    bisonc++ grammar
</pre>
    The file <code >parser.h</code> is created only once, to allow the developer to add
members to the <code >Parser</code> class occe the need for them arises.
<p>
The program <a name="an3490"></a><code >flexc++</code> is used to create a lexical scanner:
        <pre>
    flexc++ lexer
</pre>
<p>
On <a name="an3491"></a>Unix systems a command like
        <pre>
    g++ --std=c++14 -Wall -o calc *.cc -lbobcat -s
</pre>
    can be used to compile and link the source of the main program and the
sources produced by the scanner and parser generators. The example uses the
<code >A2x</code> class, which is part of the <a name="an3492"></a><code >bobcat</code> library (cf. section
<a href="cplusplus24.html#BUILDFLEX">24.8.1.5</a>) (the bobcat library is available on systems offering either
<code >bisonc++</code> or <code >flexc++</code>). <code >Bisonc++</code> can be downloaded from
