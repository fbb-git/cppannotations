8.3.2 [ISN]

  * Repaired badly formatted LaTeX table of contents: see bin/latexonly

  * Typos repaired

8.3.1

  * Many typos, textual corrections and clarifications were processed, almost
    all were provided by Francesco Poli.

  * Sections about move operations were split into subsections

  * The Portuguese translations are lagging too much behind. I've removed them
    from the source archives, although they remain available at the svn
    repository.

8.3.0

  * New sections about various (member) function adaptors 

  * Sections about statistical sampling functions added/modified

  * Sections referring to C++0x elements now assume g++ 4.4 is available and
    the required compiler version is no longer listed for those sections

  * Typos repaired

8.2.0

  * Bumped up the version. Should have been done earlier, considering that the
    'what's new' file already refers to version 8.2.0.

  * Added 'export' to the list of keywords 

  * New typos and unclear passages were processed/improved

  * KNOWN ISSUE WITH THE PDF VERSION: Due to a known bug in the ps2pdf
    conversion the pdf versions of the Annotations may show multiple
        Error: Illegal entry in bfrange block in ToUnicode CMap
    error messages. Once the bug has been repaired a new sub-minor release of
    the Annotations will be made available.

8.1.2

  * New typos and unclear passages were processed/improved

 -- Frank B. Brokken <f.b.brokken@rug.nl>  Thu, 06 May 2010 19:39:46 +0200

8.1.1

  * Many typos and minor cosmetic flaws that had escaped the previous update
    were processed

8.1.0 

  * The text and examples of the Annotations have completely been overhauled.
Before this final 8.1.0 release two pre-releases were issued, partially
completing the overhaul (see the two entries below) Over the years many
inconsistencies had crept into the text and examples, that are now removed;
streamlining the text and the examples.  All of the code examples have
received a work-over, removing endl in favor of '\n', making virtual functions
private, etc., etc. Many sections labeled C++0x were improved and sections in
the table of contents showing C++0x now also mention the g++ version in which
the new feature will be made available, using `?'  if this is as yet
unknown. No version is shown if the feature is already available in g++ 4.3
(or in one of its subreleases, like 4.3.3).  I received a host of suggestions
from Francesco Poli (thanks, Francesco (and several others), for all the
effort you've put into sending me those corrections).

 -- Frank B. Brokken <f.b.brokken@rug.nl>  Thu, 24 Dec 2009 11:36:44 +0100

8.1.0~pre1  

  * Removed the 'template concepts' section from advancedtemplates: removed
    from the C++0x standard.
  * Started a cleanup operation on the C++ Annotations aiming at improving
    its internal consistency in examples and text. In this version 
    completed until (including) chapter 8.
