To compile a bf(C++) program, a bf(C++) i(compiler) is required. Considering
the free nature of this document, it won't come as a surprise that a emi(free
compiler) is suggested here. The
    i(Free Software Foundation) (i(FSF)) provides at hi(http://www.gnu.org)
    tlurl(http://www.gnu.org) a free bf(C++)
compiler which is, among other places, also part of the i(Debian)
    hi(http://www.debian.org)
    (tlurl(http://www.debian.org)) distribution of i(Linux)
    (hi(http://www.linux.org) tlurl(http://www.linux.org)).

The upcoming i(C++0x standard) has not yet fully been implemented in the
tt(g++) compiler. Unless indicated otherwsie, all features of the C++0x
standard covered by the bf(C++) Annotations are available in tt(g++ 4.4),
unless indicated otherwise. To use these features the i(compiler flag)
ti(--std=c++0x) must currently be provided. It is assumed that this flag is
used when compiling the examples given by the Annotations. The features of the
C++0x standard may or may not be available in tt(g++) versions older than 4.4.
