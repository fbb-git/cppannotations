The relationship between the proposed classes representing different kinds of
vehicles is further investigated here. The figure shows the object hierarchy:
an tt(Auto) is a special case of a tt(Land) vehicle, which in turn is a
special case of a tt(Vehicle).

The class tt(Vehicle) represents the `greatest common divisor' in the
classification system. tt(Vehicle) is given limited functionality: it can
store and retrieve a vehicle's mass:
        verb(
    class Vehicle
    {
        size_t d_mass;

        public:
            Vehicle();
            Vehicle(size_t mass);

            size_t mass() const;
            void setMass(size_t mass);
    };
        )
    Using this class, the vehicle's mass can be defined as soon as the
corresponding object has been created. At a later stage the mass can be
changed or retrieved.

To represent vehicles travelling over land, a new class tt(Land) can be
defined offering tt(Vehicle)'s functionality and adding its own specific
functionality. Assume we are interested in the speed of land vehicles em(and)
in their mass. The relationship between tt(Vehicle)s and tt(Land)s could of
course be represented by composition but that would be awkward: composition
suggests that a tt(Land) vehicle em(is-implemented-in-terms-of), i.e.,
em(contains), a tt(Vehicle), while the natural relationship clearly is that
the tt(Land) vehicle em(is) a kind of tt(Vehicle).

A relationship in terms of composition would also somewhat complicate our
tt(Land) class's design.  Consider the following example showing a class
tt(Land) using composition (only the tt(setMass) functionality is shown):
        verb(
    class Land
    {
        Vehicle d_v;        // composed Vehicle
        public:
            void setMass(size_t mass);
    };

    void Land::setMass(size_t mass)
    {
        d_v.setMass(mass);
    }
        )
    Using composition, the tt(Land::setMass) function only passes its
argument on to tt(Vehicle::setMass). Thus, as far as mass handling is
concerned, tt(Land::setMass) introduces no extra functionality, just extra
code. Clearly this code duplication is superfluous: a tt(Land) object em(is) a
tt(Vehicle); to state that a tt(Land) object em(contains) a tt(Vehicle) is at
least somewhat peculiar.

    The intended relationship is represented better by i(inheritance).
        A i(rule of thumb) for choosing between inheritance and composition
distinguishes between em(is-a) and em(has-a) relationships. A truck em(is) a
vehicle, so tt(Truck) should probably derive from tt(Vehicle).  On the other
hand, a truck em(has) an engine; if you need to model engines in your system,
you should probably express this by composing an tt(Engine) class inside the
tt(Truck) class.

Following the above rule of thumb, tt(Land) is em(derived) from the base class
tt(Vehicle):
        verb(
    class Land: public Vehicle
    {
        size_t d_speed;
        public:
            Land();
            Land(size_t mass, size_t speed);

            void setspeed(size_t speed);
            size_t speed() const;
    };
        )
    To derive a class (e.g., tt(Land)) from another class (e.g., tt(Vehicle))
postfix the class name tt(Land) in its interface by tt(: public Vehicle):
        verb(
    class Land: public Vehicle
        )
 The class tt(Land) now contains all the functionality of its base class
tt(Vehicle) as well as its own features. Here those features are a constructor
expecting two arguments and member functions to access the tt(d_speed) data
member. Here is an example showing the possibilities of the derived class
tt(Land):
        verb(
    Land veh(1200, 145);

    int main()
    {
        cout << "Vehicle weighs " << veh.mass() << ";\n"
                "its speed is " << veh.speed() << '\n';
    }
        )
    This example illustrates two features of derivation.
    itemization(
    it() First, tt(mass) is not mentioned as a member in tt(Land)'s
interface. Nevertheless it is used in tt(veh.mass).  This member function is
an implicit part of the class, inherited from its `parent' vehicle.
    it() Second, although the derived class tt(Land) contains the
functionality of tt(Vehicle), the tt(Vehicle)'s private members remain
private: they can only be accessed by tt(Vehicle)'s own member functions. This
means that tt(Land)'s member functions em(must) use tt(Vehicle)'s member
functions (like tt(mass) and tt(setMass)) to address the tt(mass)
field. Here there's no difference between the access rights granted to
tt(Land) and the access rights granted to other code outside of the class
tt(Vehicle). The class tt(Vehicle) hi(encapsulation) em(encapsulates) the
specific tt(Vehicle) characteristics, and i(data hiding) is one way to realize
encapsulation.
    )

    Encapsulation is a core principle of good class design. Encapsulation
reduces the dependencies among classes improving the maintainability and
testability of classes and allowing us to modify classes without the need to
modify depending code. By strictly complying with the principle of data hiding
a class's internal data organization may change without requiring depending
code to be changed as well. E.g., a class tt(Lines) originally storing
bf(C)-strings could at some point have its data organization changed. It could
abandone its tt(char **) storage in favor of a tt(vector<string>) based
storage. When tt(Lines) uses perfect data hiding depending source code
may use the new tt(Lines) class without requiring any modification at all.

As a i(rule of thumb), derived classes must be fully recompiled (but don't
have to be modified) when the em(data organization) (i.e., the data members)
of their base classes change.  Adding new member em(functions) to the base
class doesn't alter the data organization so no i(recompilation) is needed
when new member em(functions) are added.

There is one subtle exception to this rule of thumb: if a new member function
is added to a base class and that function happens to be declared as the first
em(virtual) member function of the base class (cf. chapter ref(POLYMORPHISM)
for a discussion of the virtual member function concept) then that
em(also) changes the data organization of the base class.

Now that tt(Land) has been derived from tt(Vehicle) we're ready for our next
class derivation. We'll define a class tt(Auto) to represent
automobiles. Agreeing that an tt(Auto) object is a tt(Land) vehicle, and that
an tt(Auto) has a brand name it's easy to design the class tt(Auto):
        verb(
    class Auto: public Land
    {
        std::string d_brandName;

        public:
            Auto();
            Auto(size_t mass, size_t speed, std::string const &name);

            std::string const &brandName() const;
    };
        )
    In the above class definition, tt(Auto) was derived from tt(Land), which in
turn is derived from tt(Vehicle). This is called emi(nested derivation):
tt(Land) is called tt(Auto)'s emi(direct base class), while tt(Vehicle) is
called tt(Auto)'s  emi(indirect base class).
