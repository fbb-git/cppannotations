The following i(file modes) or i(file flags) are available when constructing
or opening tt(ofstream) (or tt(istream), see section ref(IFSTREAM))
objects. The values are of type hi(openmode)tt(ios::openmode). Flags may be
combined using the tt(bitor) operator.
        itemization(
        ithtq(app)(ios::app)
            (reposition the stream to its end before every output command (see
also tt(ios::ate) below). The
file is created if it doesn't yet exist. When opening a stream in this mode
any existing contents of the file are kept.)
        ithtq(ate)(ios::ate)
            (start initially at the end of the file.  Note that any existing
contents are em(only) kept if some other flag tells the object to do so. For
example tt(ofstream out("gone", ios::ate)) will
    em(rewrite) the file tt(gone), because the implied tt(ios::out) will cause
the rewriting. If rewriting of an existing file should be prevented, the
tt(ios::in) hi(in)hi(file rewriting: preventing) mode should be specified
too. However, when tt(ios::in) is specified the file must already exist. The
tt(ate) mode only initially positions the file at the end of file
position. After that information may be written in the middle of the file
using tt(seekp). When the tt(app) mode is used information will em(only) to
written at end of file (effectively ignoring tt(seekp) operations).)
        ithtq(binary)(ios::binary)
            (open a file in hi(file: binary mode)binary mode (used on systems
distinguishing text- and binary files, like i(MS-Windows)).
        )
        ithtq(in)(ios::in)
            (open the file for reading. The file must exist.)
        ithtq(out)(ios::out)
            (open the file for writing. Create it if it doesn't yet exist. If
it exists, the i(file is rewritten).)
        ithtq(trunc)(ios::trunc)
        (start initially with an empty file.  Any existing contents of the
file are lost.)
        )
    The following combinations of file flags have special meanings:
        verb(
    in | out:           The stream may be read and written. However, the
                        file must exist.
    in | out | trunc:   The stream may be read and written. It is
                        (re)created empty first.
        )
    An interesting subtlety is that the tt(open) members of the tt(ifstream,
ofstream) and tt(fstream) classes have a second parameter of type
tt(ios::openmode). In contrast to this, the tt(bitor) operator returns an
tt(int) when applied to two enum-values. The question why the tt(bitor)
operator may nevertheless be used here is answered in a later chapter
(cf. section ref(EnumOverload)).
