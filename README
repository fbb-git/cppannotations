 The C++ Annotations offer an extensive tutorial about the C++ programming
 language. It can be used as a textbook for C/C++ programming courses.

The C++ Annotation's repository has moved to https://gitlab.com/fbb-git/cppannotations
and is not maintained at this location anymore.

The project's web-page can be found at http://fbb-git.gitlab.io/cppannotations
